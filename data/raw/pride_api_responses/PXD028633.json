  "projectDescription": "Immunopeptidomics is an emerging field that fuels and guides the development of vaccines and immunotherapies. More specifically, it refers to the science of investigating the composition of peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules using mass spectrometry (MS) technology platforms. Among all the steps in a MS-based immunopeptidomic workflow, sample preparationis critically important for capturing high-quality data of therapeutic relevance. Here, we describe step-by-step instructions to isolate MHC class I and II-associated peptides by immunoaffinity purification from quality control (QC) samples. Our QC samples are MHC class I and class II peptides isolated from mouse (EL4 and A20) and human (JY) cell lines. We thoroughly describe the various reagents and specfic antibodies that are used too isolate MHC-associated peptides from these cell lines, including the steps to verify the beads-binding efficiency of the antibody and the elution efficiency of the MHC-peptide complexes from the beads. QC samples generated using the described protocol can be used to establish and standardize immunopeptidomic workflow, as well as to benchmark new protocols. We anticipate that the visualized protocol provided in this report will represent a great starting point for any non-expert in addition to foster the instra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility of the sample preparation procedure in immunopeptidomics.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Antibodies (anti-MHC I and anti-MHC-II) were coupled to sepharose CNBr-activated beads. Cells were lysed using 0.5% chaps buffer. Acidic elution of MHC-peptide complexes using 1% TFA followed by desalting and elution of MHC peptides using 28% ACN/0.1% TFA.",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "Data files from the three injections/sample are processed using PEAKS X software (Peaks Pro V10.6, Bioinformatics Solutions, Waterloo, ON) using the mouse and human databases (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (2019_09)). ‘Unspecified enzyme digestion’ is selected for the enzyme parameter and mass tolerances on precursor and fragment ions are 10 ppm and 0.01 Da, respectively. Variable modifications are deamidation (NQ) and oxidation (M). All other search parameters are the default values. Final peptide lists are filtered using ALC of 80% and with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1 % using the PEAKS software. To visualize the data and assess their overall quality, composition and MHC-specificity, MhcVizPipe (MVP) software tool (https://github.com/CaronLab/MhcVizPipe) was used.",
