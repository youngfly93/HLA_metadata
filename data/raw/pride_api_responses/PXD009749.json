  "projectDescription": "MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "1-2 x 106 B-ALL cells were thawed and transplanted via i.v. injection into 8–12-week-old sub-lethally irradiated (250 cGy, 137 Cs-gamma source) NSG mice. Mice were sacrificed at signs of disease and cell suspensions were prepared from a mix of splenocytes, bone marrow and peritoneal ascites. From there, Ficoll gradients were used to enrich for B-ALL cells prior to MAP isolation. MHC I-associated peptides from three replicates of 650 x 10^6 cells were obtained by mild acid elution using, per replicate, 2.5ml of citrate buffer at pH 3.3 (0.131M citric acid / 0.066M Na2HPO4, 150mM NaCl) containing aprotinin and iodoacetamide (1:100). Peptides were then desalted on an Oasis HLB cartridge (30 mg, Waters) and filtered on a 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off (Amicon Ultra-4, Millipore) to remove 𝛽2m proteins. After being dried using a Speed-Vac, peptides were re-suspended in 0.2 % formic acid, loaded on a home-made C18 analytical column (15 cm x 150 𝜇m i.d. packed with C18 Jupiter Phenomenex) with a 56-min gradient from 0–40 % acetonitrile (0.2 % formic acid) and a 600 nl.min-1 flow rate on a nEasy-LC II system. Samples were analyzed with a Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each full MS spectrum, acquired with a 60,000 resolution, was followed by 20 MS/MS spectra, where the most abundant multiply charged ions were selected for MS/MS sequencing with a resolution of 15,000, an automatic gain control target of 5e4, an injection time of 100 ms and a collision energy of 25 %.",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the 07H103 global cancer database that was built using 07H103 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCh38.88, total number of proteins in database: 1,385,936). For peptide identification, tolerance was set at 10 ppm and 0.01 Da for precursor and fragment ions, respectively. Occurrence of oxidation (M) and deamidation (NQ) were considered as post-translational modifications.",
