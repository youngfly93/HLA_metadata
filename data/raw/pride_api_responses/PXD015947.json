  "projectDescription": "HLA ligandome analysis of colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues obtained from liver metastases (mCRC) as well as adjacent non-malignant liver tissues was performed to characterize the natural HLA class I and class II presented ligands on both mCRC and adjacent liver tissue.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Immunopreciptiation of HLA class I and II molecules was performed by described previously standard methods (Kowalewski et al. Methods Mol Biol. 2013; 960:145-157.). For HLA class I immunoprecipitation, pan-HLA class I-specific mAb W6/32 (Barnstable et al. Cell. 1978; 14(1):9-20.) was employed and for HLA class II pan-HLA class II mAb Tü39 (Ziegler et al. Immunobiology. 1986; 171(1-2):77-92.) as well as HLA-DR-specific mAb L243 (Goldman et al. Br J Haematol. 1982; 52(3):411-20.) were used and subsequently eluted in each case, using 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide extracts were separated by nanoflow uHPLC using a 50μm × 25 cm column (PepMap RSLC, ThermoFisher) and an acetonitrile gradient ranging from 2.4 to 32.0% over the course of 90 min. Samples were analyzed in up to six technical replicates of each sample, as previously described (Löffler et al. Cancer Res. 2018; 78(16):4627-4641. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-1745). Eluting peptides were analyzed in an online coupled linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher), equipped with a nanoelectron spray ion source, employing a top 5 collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation method. Sample weight of tissues employed for lysis and HLA ligand isolation is provided in Table 1 in (Löffler et al. Front. Immunol. 2019; 10:2526. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02526).",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "The Mascot search engine (Mascot 2.2.04, Matrix Science, Boston, MA) was used to search the human proteome contained in the Swiss-Prot database (20,279 reviewed protein sequences, as of September 2013) without any enzymatic restriction (required Mascot ion score ≥20; search engine rank: 1). As a dynamic modification oxidized methionine was allowed. The false discovery rate was estimated with the Percolator algorithm (Käll et al. Nat Methods. 2007; 4(11):923-5. https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth1113) and set to 5%. Peptide lengths for HLA class I-eluted peptides were limited from 8 to 12 amino acids (required charge state: 2–3) and for HLA class II-eluted peptides from 9 to 25 amino acids (required charge state: 2–5). Protein inference was disabled, allowing for multiple protein annotations of peptides. Files are labelled according to identifiers (IRISS) given in Table 1 in (Löffler et al. Front. Immunol. 2019; 10:2526. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02526). Files are categorized according to assessed sample materials as Tumor (metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma; bulk tissue; malignant), NMT (liver; bulk tissue; non-malignant). Technical replicates are labelled as Rep#.",
