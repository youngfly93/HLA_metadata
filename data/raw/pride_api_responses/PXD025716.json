  "title": "Upstream open reading frames regulate proto-oncogene translation and encode HLA-presented immunogenic tumor antigens",
  "additionalAttributes": [],
  "projectDescription": "Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) represent translational control elements within eukaryotic transcript leader sequences. Recent data showed that uORFs can encode for biologically active proteins and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-presented peptides and suggest their potential role in cancer cell development and survival. However, it is so far unclear if uORF-encoded peptides could serve as tumor-associated antigen targets and thus also play a role in cancer immune surveillance. Combining mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome analysis in primary tumor and healthy tissues and evaluation of proto-oncogene-associated uORF-mediated translational control we here identified a panel of HLA-presented tumor-associated uORF-derived antigens. These uORF-derived tumor antigens were further shown to induce multifunctional antigen-specific T cells, validating their suitability as antigen targets for T cell-based cancer immunotherapy. Our data further unravel the role of uORF-encoded peptides in malignant disease, suggesting uORF-derived tumor-associated antigens as targets for anti-cancer immune surveillance and immunotherapy development.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "HLA class I molecules were isolated from primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as hematological benign samples by standard immunoaffinity purification using the pan-HLA class I-specific antibody W6/32 . Purified peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using two state-of-the-art mass spectrometers.",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "MS data analysis was carried out using Proteome discoverer. Peak lists were searched against the human proteome as comprised in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (20,367 reviewed protein sequences, January 7th 2020) supplemented with two datasets of uORF sequences using the SEQUEST HT search engine. Mass tolerance for processing was 5 ppm for precursor ions and 0.5 Da for ion trap fragment ions and 0.02 Da for orbitrap fragment ions. No cleavage specificity was selected, and the only dynamic modification allowed was oxidized methionine. Peptide confidence was determined using percolator algorithm with a target value of q ≤ 0.05 (5% FDR. Additional post processing filters were search engine rank = 1 and peptide length of 8-12 amino acids.",
