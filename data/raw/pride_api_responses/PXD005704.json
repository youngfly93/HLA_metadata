  "title": "Antigen Presentation Profiling Reveals T-cell Recognition of Lymphoma Immunoglobulin Neoantigens",
  "additionalAttributes": [],
  "projectDescription": "Cancer somatic mutations can generate neoantigens that distinguish malignant from normal cells. Such neoantigens have been implicated in response to immunotherapies including immune checkpoint blockade, yet their identification and validation remains challenging. Here we discover neoantigens in human mantle cell lymphomas using an integrated strategy for genomic and proteomic tumor antigen discovery that interrogates peptides presented within the tumor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules. We applied this approach to systematically identify neoantigen peptides in diagnostic tumor specimens from 17 patients and several cell lines. Remarkably, the discovered neoantigenic peptides were invariably derived from the lymphoma immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy or light chain variable regions. Although we could identify MHC presentation of private germline polymorphic alleles, no mutated peptides were recovered from non-Ig somatically mutated genes. The immunoglobulin variable region somatic mutations were almost exclusively presented by MHC-II. We found T-cells specific for an immunoglobulin-derived neoantigen in the blood of a patient using MHC-II tetramers, and these T-cell clones expanded in frequency following tumor vaccination. These results demonstrate that an integrative approach combining MHC isolation, peptide identification and exome sequencing is an effective platform to uncover tumor neoantigens. Application of this strategy to human lymphoma implicates immunoglobulin neoantigens as targets for lymphoma immunotherapy.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "MHC-class I peptidomes were extracted from both a Raji wildtype and a Raji transduced cell line with the HLA B*35:01 allele. In brief, cells were lysed and the lysate was subjected to centrifugation and then precleared using rProtein A Sepharose fast-flow beads (GE Healthcare). The precleared lysate was incubated with the pan HLA-A-, B-, and C- antibody W6/32 coupled to rProtein A Sepharose fast-flow beads. Following the immune-capture, the beads were washed with TBS and peptides were eluted from the purified MHC-molecules using 10% acetic acid. The peptides were further purified with a MWCO size filter, followed by a concentration step and then desalted on C18 based StageTips. The isolated peptides were analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific).",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "All tandem mass spectra were queried against a Raji-cell line specific database using both SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994) and PEAKS DB search engines (PEAKS Studio 7) (Zhang et al., 2012). Spectra were also interpreted by de novo sequencing (PEAKS Studio 7) to improve high-confidence peptide identification. For all searches with SEQUEST the msConvert program (v3.0.45) was used to generate peak lists from the original data, and spectra were then assigned to peptides using the SEQUEST (v28.12) algorithm. For all searches with PEAKS the RAW data files were imported into PEAKS and subjected to default data refinement (deisotoping, charge deconvolution, peak centroiding). For all searches, the parent mass error tolerance was set to 20 ppm and the fragment mass error tolerance to 0.02 Da. For SEQUEST and PEAKS DB, enzyme specificity was set to none and oxidation of methionines and deamidation (N,Q), cysteinylation, and phosphorylation (S, T, Y) was searched as a variable modification. High-confidence peptide identifications were selected at a 1% false discovery rate with the Percolator algorithm (Käll et al., 2007).",
