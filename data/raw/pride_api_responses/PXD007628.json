  "title": "MHC II immunopeptidome during Plasmodium berghei blood stage infection",
  "additionalAttributes": [],
  "projectDescription": "In malaria, T cells play a dual role by both restricting parasite growth and mediating immunopathology such as the deadly neuroinflammation called cerebral malaria.  During experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), IFN produced by CD4 T cells promotes CD8 T cell sequestration in brain capillaries, resulting in endothelial damage, oedema and death.  However the antigen-presenting cells controlling the development of CD4 T cell responses, as well as the antigens recognized by these CD4 T cells, are unknown. Here we used mass spectrometry to characterize the MHC II immunopeptidome presented by dendritic cells during blood stage malaria in C57BL/6 mice.  We identified 14 MHC II ligands derived from 13 conserved Plasmodium berghei proteins that we validated in vivo.  This work profiles the first MHC II immunopeptidome in a mouse model of blood stage malaria.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "MHC II molecules were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate using 50 µg of Y-3P antibody (BioXCell) bound to protein-G beads overnight at 4°C.  Beads were washed 3 times, peptides were eluted with 10% acetic acid at 70°C for 10 min. Prior to analysis to nanoLC-MSMS, peptides were separated from protein using a Vivaspin concentrator with 10 kDa MW cutoff.  Peptides were subjected to solid-phase extraction using a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge and finally concentrated using a rotating evaporator.  Nano-LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  Peptides were automatically fractionated onto a C18 reverse-phase column (75 µm×150 mm, 2 µm particle, PepMap100 RSLC column, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a temperature of 35°C.  Trapping was performed during 4 min at 5 μL/min, with solvent A (98 % H2O, 2% ACN and 0.1 % FA).  Elution was performed using two solvents A (0,1 % FA in water) and B (0,1 % FA in ACN) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.  Gradient separation was 36 min from 2 % B to 40% B, 2 min to 90% B, and maintained for 5 min.  The column was equilibrated for 13 min with 5% buffer B prior to the next sample analysis.  The electrospray voltage was 1.9 kV, and the capillary temperature was 275 °C.  Full MS scans were acquired over m/z 400–2000 range with resolution 70,000 (m/z 200).  The target value was 1.00E+06.  Ten most intense peaks with charge state between 2 and 7 were fragmented in the HCD collision cell with normalized collision energy of 35%, and tandem mass spectrum was acquired with resolution 35,000 at m/z 200.  The target value was 2.00E+05.  The ion selection threshold was 6.7E+04 counts and the maximum allowed ion accumulation times were 250 ms for full MS scans and 150 ms for tandem mass spectrum.  Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s.",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "Raw data collected during nano-LC-MS/MS analyses were processed and converted into *.mgf peak list format with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  MS/MS data was interpreted using search engine Mascot (version 2.4.1, Matrix Science, London, UK) installed on a local server.  Searches were performed with a tolerance on mass measurement of 0.02 Da for precursor and 10 ppm for fragment ions, against a composite target decoy database (189576 total entries) built with Plasmodium Berghei UniProt database (TaxID=5823, 03 December 2015, 13853 entries), Mus Musculus UniProt database (TaxID=10090, 03 December 2015, 78986 entries) fused with the sequences of recombinant trypsin and a list of classical contaminants (117 entries).  Methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation were searched as variable modifications and no enzyme was indicated.  For each sample, peptides were filtered out according to the cut-off set for proteins hits with 1 or more peptides taller than 9 residues and ion score > 19, allowing a false positive identification rate of 2.5% for protein and 0.4% for peptides.",
