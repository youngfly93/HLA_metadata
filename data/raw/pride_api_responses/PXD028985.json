  "projectDescription": "Analysis of the immunopeptidome of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A*11:01 during influenza infection. Analyses were performed using the Class I reduced C1R cell line transfected with the HLA class I allele HLA-A*11:01.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Cells were infected with Influenza A virus (A/X31) or Influenza B virus (B/Malaysia/2506/04). Cells were lysed and HLA-I molecules were isolated using the pan HLA-I antibody W6/32. HLA-bound peptides were acid eluted, fractionated by RP-HPLC, vacuum concentrated and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "Data were searched using PEAKS 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.) database search against the reviewed human proteome (uniprot April 2016) in addition to the proteome and 6 frame translated nucleotide sequence of either A/X31 or B/Malaysia/2506/04.  A contaminant database of common LC-MS/MS contaminants was employed. False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis was performed by decoy-fusion. For initial searches the following settings were employed: Instrument – OrbiTrap (Orbi-Orbi), Fragment – HCD, Parent Mass Error Tolerance - 10.0 ppm, Fragment Mass Error Tolerance - 0.02 Da, Precursor Mass Search Type - monoisotopic, Enzyme - None, Variable Modifications - Oxidation (M) 15.99 and Deamidation (NQ) 0.98, Max Variable PTM Per Peptide - 3. A second search against the human + A/X31 database was also performed incorporating additional variable modifications: Oxidation (M) 15.99, Deamidation (NQ) 0.98, Dioxidation (M) 31.99, Dihydroxy (YWFRKPC) 31.99, Cysteine oxidation to cysteic acid (C) 47.98.",
