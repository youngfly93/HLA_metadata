  "projectDescription": "10 cervical cancer tissue tumour resections were analysed using an immunopeptidomics workflow.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "1 mL Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were washed in 50 mM borate, 50 mM KCl (pH 8.0) solution and then incubated with 2 mg of pan-HLA-I antibody (W6/32) slowly rotating for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed in a column format with 0.2 M triethanolamine (pH 8.2), and the bound antibody was cross-linked by incubation with 40 mM dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride (DMP) (Sigma) (pH 8.3) for 1 h at room temperature. Ice-cold 0.2 M Tris buffer (pH 8.0) was added to the mixture to stop the reaction. Unbound antibody was washed off the column by washing with 0.1 M citrate (pH 3.0), and the column was equilibrated in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) for further use. 5 × 108 cells pellets were lysed by using 10 mL lysis buffer (0.5% IGEPAL 630, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)), and mixed for 30 min. Tissues were homogenized using a bead-beater (Bertin Instruments). The lysate was centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min to remove nuclei and then at 15,000 g for 60 min to pellet other insoluble material. 1 mL W6/32 cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads (GE) was added to cleared lysates for 1h, and beads were washed with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing first 150 mM NaCl, then 450 mM NaCl, and next no salt. HLA-peptide complexes were eluted by using 5 mL 10% acetic acid and dried. After immunoprecipitation, peptide-HLA complexes were resuspended in 120 μL loading buffer (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 1% acetonitrile (ACN) in water). Samples were fractioned by reverse-phase (RP) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Ultimate 300 HPLC system (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with a 4.6- by 50-mm Pro-Swift RP-1S column (Thermo Scientific). Samples were loaded onto the column and eluted using a 10 min linear gradient from 3% to 30% ACN in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 500 nL/min, and elution was monitored by light absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions were collected in 1-min intervals. Alternate fractions were combined in two final fractions (odd and even). Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS2 using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano System supplemented with a PepMap C18 column, 2 μm particle size, 75 μm × 50 cm (Thermo Scientific) directly interphased with a Q-Exactive HFX Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). A 60 min linear gradient from 3% to 25% ACN in 1% DMSO/0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 250 nL/min was applied for peptide elution. Peptide ions were introduced to the mass spectrometer using an Easy-Spray Source at 2000 V.  Ions were analyzed by data-dependent acquisition. Initially a full-MS1 scan (120,000 resolution, 60 ms accumulation time, AGC 3X106) was followed by 20 data-dependent MS2 scans (60,000 resolution, 120 ms accumulation time, AGC 5X105), with an isolation width of 1.6 m/z and normalized HCD energy of 25%.",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "Data was analalysed by Peaks X software (Bioinformatics Solutions). A score threshold of -lg10P=20 was applied to achieve an overall FDR of 2.1% and 37661 peptide identifications.",
