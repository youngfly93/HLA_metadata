  "projectDescription": "Comprehensive knowledge of the HLA class-I and class-II peptides presented to T-cells is crucial for designing innovative therapeutics against cancer and other diseases. However methodologies for their extraction for mass-spectrometry analysis have been a major limitation. We designed a novel high-throughput, reproducible and sensitive method for sequential extraction of HLA-I and -II peptides from up to 96 samples in a plate format from cell lines or tissues. Our methodology drastically reduces sample-handling and can be completed within six hours. We report identification and quantification of thousands of peptides with excellent reproducibility (Pearson correlations reaching 0.98 and 0.97, class I and II, respectively). Due to improved sensitivity, as many as 1,846 HLA-I and 2,633 HLA-II peptides were accurately identified from only 107 B-cells. We demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug-screening by using ovarian cancer cells treated with interferon gamma. This straightforward method is applicable for basic and clinical applications.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "For high-throughput HLA-I and HLA-II purification, we employ the Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor (Waters, 186006961) and customized it by adding extended self-made metal rods to accommodate the stacking of up to five 96-well plates. We used for immuno-affinity purifications the 96-well micro-plate with 3Âµm glass fiber and 10Âµm polypropylene membranes which are compatible with the processor and are commercially available (Seahorse Bioscience, 360063).The positive pressure processor was used in each step of the procedure to generate homogenous flow of liquid through the plates.  Preparation of lysates: In the first experimental set-up we purified the HLA-I and II peptidome from JY, CD165, PD42, CM467, RA957, TIL1 and TIL3. Cell lysis was performed with PBS containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich, 30970), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, I6125), 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 04693132001), 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Roche, 329-98-6), 1% octyl-beta-D glucopyranoside (Sigma-Alrich, 08001) at 4°C for 1 hour.  In general, lysis buffer was added to the cells at a concentration of 1 x 108 cells/mL. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation with a table-top centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge, 5430R) at 4°C at 14200 rpm for 50 min. For each cell line, lysate from a total of 3 x 108 cells were pooled and evenly distributed as 1 x 108 triplicates into designated wells. In a second experimental set-up, snap-frozen meningioma tissue samples were placed in tubes containing ice cold lysis buffer (mentioned above) and homogenized on ice in 3-5 short intervals of 5 seconds each using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (IKA, T10 standard) with maximum speed. For one gram of tissue, 10 mL of lysis buffer was required. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm in a high speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, JSS15314) at 4°C for 50 minutes. To test the limits of sensitivity with our method, we extracted HLA-I and -II peptides from 10, 30, 50 and 70 million cells as described above and we split the lysate of 1.3 x 108 CD165 B-cells proportionally to the desired cell amount; this was performed in triplicates. Last, four replicates of 1.5 x 108 UWB.1 289 cells untreated and four replicates treated with IFNy were processed separately but in parallel for HLAp extraction. Preparation of plates: First, empty platesâ€™ wells were washed and equilibrated with 1 ml of 100% acetonitrile (ACN; Sigma-Aldrich, 34967), followed by 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid wash (TFA; Merck Millipore, 1082620100)  and last with 2 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15568025). Anti-pan HLA-I and HLA-II antibodies cross-linked to beads were loaded on their respective plates (named â€œHLA Iâ€ and â€œHLA IIâ€, see Figure 1 and Supplementary Video 1) at a final bead volume of 75 uL in 0.1 M Tris-HCl. For tissue samples, a depletion step of endogenous antibodies was required. Therefore, an additional plate (named â€œPre-clearâ€ plate) with wells containing 100 uL Pro-A beads was prepared. The beads alone or antibodies cross-linked to beads were conditioned with lysis buffer before lysate loading. Purification of HLA-I and HLA-II peptides: Two Sep-Pak tC18 96-well plates (Waters, 186002321) were required for the purification and concentration of HLA-I and HLA-II peptides. Each Sep-Pak plate was handled separately. Firstly, we conditioned the plates with 1 mL of 80% ACN in 0.1 % TFA and then with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA. The affinity plate was stacked on top of the C18 plate to achieve direct elution of the HLA complexes and the bound peptides with 500 uL 1% TFA. This is followed by washing the Sep-Pak wells with 2 mL of 0.1 % TFA. Thereafter we eluted the HLA-I peptides with 500 uL of 28% ACN in 0.1% TFA. HLA-II peptides were eluted from the class II Sep-Pak plate with 500 uL of 32% ACN in 0.1% TFA. Both HLA-I and -II peptides elutions were transferred into eppendorf tubes. Recovered HLA-I and -II peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, N09Y-442492-NY) and stored at -20C. Dry peptides were resuspended in a designated volume prior to injection into the mass spectrometry.",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "We employed the MaxQuant computational proteomics platform version 1.5.5.1 4 to search the peak lists against the UniProt databases (Human 42,148 entries, March 2017) and a file containing 247 frequently observed contaminants. N-terminal acetylation (42.010565 Da) and methionine oxidation (15.994915 Da) were set as variable modifications. The second peptide identification option in Andromeda was enabled. A false discovery rate of 0.01 and no protein false discovery rate was set for peptidomics analysis while a protein FDR of 0.01 was set for proteomic analysis. The enzyme specificity was set as unspecific for peptidomics analysis, while C-term specificity for K and R, and max 2 miscleavages were chosen for analysis of proteomics samples. Possible sequence matches were restricted to 8 to 25 amino acids, a maximum peptides mass of 4600 Da. The initial allowed mass deviation of the precursor ion was set to 6 ppm and the maximum fragment mass deviation was set to 20 ppm. We enabled the â€˜match between runsâ€™ option, which allows matching of identifications across different replicates of the same biological sample in a time window of 0.5 min and an initial alignment time window of 20 min. For proteomic analysis, â€˜matched between runsâ€™ module was enabled for all samples and label-free quantification was enabled in the MaxQuant environment.",
