  "projectDescription": "We surveyed the immunopeptidome of neuroblastoma tumors to identify tumor-specific targets derived from non-mutated self proteins originating from core-regulatory circuit proteins.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "HLA class I molecules were isolated using standard immunoaffinity purification as described previously. In brief, cell pellets were lysed in 10 mM CHAPS/PBS (AppliChem/Lonza) containing 1x protease inhibitor (Complete; Roche). Mouse MHC molecules were removed using a 1 h immunoaffinity purification with H-2K-specific mAb 20-8-4S, covalently linked to CNBr-activated sepharose (GE Healthcare). Remaining HLA molecules were purified overnight using the pan-HLA class I-specific mAb W6/32 or a mix of the pan-HLA class II-specific mAb Tü39 and the HLA-DR-specific mAb L243, covalently linked to CNBr-activated. MHC-peptide complexes were eluted by repeated addition of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (Merck). Elution fractions E1-E4 were pooled, and free MHC ligands were isolated by ultrafiltration using centrifugal filter units (Amicon; Merck Millipore). MHC ligands were extracted and desalted from the filtrate using ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Merck Millipore). Extracted peptides were eluted in 35 µl of acetonitrile (Merck)/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, centrifuged to complete dryness and resuspended in 25 µl of 1% acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were stored at -20°C until analysis by LC-MS/MS.",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "Data was processed against the human proteome as comprised in the Swiss-Prot database (www.uniprot.org, release: May 27th 2021; 20,395 reviewed protein sequences contained) using the SequestHT algorithm (3) in the Proteome Discoverer (v2.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) software. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm, fragment mass tolerance to 0.02 Da. Search was not restricted to an enzymatic specificity. Oxidized methionine was allowed as a dynamic modification. False discovery rate (FDR) was determined by the Percolator algorithm based on processing against a decoy database consisting of shuffled sequences. FDR was set to 1%. Peptide lengths were limited to 8-14 amino acids for MHC class I.",
