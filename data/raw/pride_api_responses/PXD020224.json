  "projectDescription": "Many tumors escape by activating multiple cellular pathways that induce immunosuppression. One pivotal immune-suppressive mechanism is the production of tryptophan metabolites along the kynurenine pathway by IFNγ-induced IDO1 enzyme production 4-8. Phase III clinical trials using chemical inhibition of IDO1 in combination with PD1 pathway blockade, however, failed to improve melanoma treatment 9-12. This points at an incomplete understanding of the role of IDO1 and the consequent tryptophan degradation on mRNA translation and cancer progression. Here, we investigated the effects of prolonged IFNγ treatment on mRNA translation in melanoma cells by ribosome profiling. Surprisingly, we observed a massive accumulation of ribosomes ~20 amino acids downstream of tryptophan codons (termed here as W-Bumps) along with their expected stalling at the tryptophan codon itself. This indicated ribosomal bypass of the tryptophan codons in the absence of tryptophan. Detailed examination of W-Bumps position and its corresponding peptide sequences pinpointed towards ribosomal frameshifting events and their effects in the ribosome exit tunnel. In particular, W-Bumps strength was associated with the disorderedness level of potential out-of-frame peptides predicted downstream of tryptophan codons. Indeed, reporter assays demonstrated the induction of ribosomal frameshifting, and the generation of trans-frame proteins and their presentation at the cell surface after IFNγ treatment. Proteomics and immunopeptidomics analyses verified the production of IFNγ-induced trans-frame and out-of-frame aberrant peptides and their presentation on HLA class I molecules. Priming of naïve T cells from healthy donors with aberrant peptides resulted in identification of reactive, peptide-specific T cells. Altogether, our results suggest that IFNγ-induced IDO1-mediated tryptophan depletion plays a role in the immune recognition of melanoma cells by contributing to the diversity of the peptidome landscape, and by inducing the presentation of aberrant peptides.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "For single-shot  proteomics, frozen MD55A3 cell pellets were lysed, reduced and alkylated in heated guanidine (GuHCl) lysis buffer. Proteins were digested with Lys-C (Wako) for 2h at 37°C, enzyme/substrate ratio 1:100. The mixture was then diluted to 2 M GuHCl and digested overnight at 37°C with trypsin (Sigma) in enzyme/substrate ratio 1:50. Digestion was quenched by the addition of TFA (final concentration 1%), after which the peptides were desalted on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Massachusetts, USA). Samples were vacuum dried and stored at -80°C until LC-MS/MS analysis. Peptides were reconstituted in 2% formic acid and analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS on an Q Exactive HF-X Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer equipped with an EASY-NLC 1200 system (Thermo Scientific). For the detection of frameshifted polypeptides, deeper proteome coverage in search of IFNγ-induced frameshifts was needed. IFNγ- or mock treated melanoma cells were lysed and digested as described above, after which dried digests were subjected to basic reversed-phase (HpH-RP) high-performance liquid chromatography for offline peptide fractionation. 250 μg peptid 479 es were reconstituted in 95% 10 mM ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, solvent A)/5% (90% acetonitrile (ACN)/10mM NH4OH, solvent B) and loaded onto a Phenomenex Kinetex EVO C18 analytical column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, particle size 5 μm, 100 Å pores) coupled to an Agilent 1260 HPLC system equipped with a fraction collector. All fractions were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer equipped with an Easy-nLC1000 system (Thermo Scientific). For immunopeptidomics analysis, MD55A3 cell pellets were subjected to HLA-purification. Cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2mM iodoacetamide, 1mM EDTA, 1:200 protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1mM PMSF and 1%octyl-b-D glucopyranoside in PBS, and then incubated at 4°C for 1 hour. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4°C and 48,000g for 60 minutes, and then passed through a pre-clearing column containing Protein-A Sepharose beads (GenScript). HLA-I molecules were immunoaffinity purified from cleared lysate with the pan-HLA-I antibody (W6/32 antibody purified from HB95 hybridoma cells) covalently bound to Protein-A Sepharose beads). Affinity column was washed first with 10 column volumes of 400mM NaCl, 20mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 and then with 10 volumes of 20mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0. The HLA peptides and HLA molecules were eluted with 1% TFA followed by separation of the peptides from the proteins by binding the eluted fraction to disposable reversed-phase Sep-Pak tC18 (Waters). Elution of the peptides was done with 30% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid (TFA). The HLA peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation, re-solubilized with 0.1% formic acid and separated using reversed phase chromatography using the nanoAquity system (Waters Corp., USA), with a Symmetry trap column (180x20mm) and HSS T3 analytical column, 0.75x250mm (Waters Corp. USA). The chromatography system was coupled by electrospray to tandem mass spectrometry to Q-Exactive-Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific).",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "For single-shot proteomics, RAW files were analyzed by Proteome Discoverer (version 2.3.0.523, Thermo Scientific) using standard settings. MS/MS data were searched in Sequest HT against the the human Swissprot database (20,381 entries, release 2018_08). The maximum allowed precursor mass tolerance was 50 ppm and 0.06 Da for fragment ion masses. False discovery rates for peptide and protein identification were set to 1%. Trypsin was chosen as cleavage specificity allowing two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification, whereas oxidation (M) and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Peptide spectrum matches (PSM) were filtered for Sequest HT Xcorr score ≥ 1. The Proteome Discoverer output file containing the LFQ abundances was loaded into Perseus (version 1.6.5.0) 71. Abundances were Log2-transformed and the proteins were filtered for at least two out of three valid values in one condition. Missing values were replaced by imputation based on the standard settings of Perseus, i.e. a normal distribution using a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 1.8. Differentially expressed proteins were determined using a t-test (threshold: FDR 1% or FDR 5% and S0: 0.13). GENCODE annotations (gencode v19) were used to calculate number of amino acids per protein as well as the least distance between a particular amino-acid (W,Y and N) Boxplots for every group were plotted in R. Statistical tests were down using Wilcoxon test in R. For the detection of frameshifted polypeptides, the CDS sequences of GRCh38 were downloaded from Ensembl 73. Prime transcripts (annotated as -001), which contain tryptophan codon and are highly expressed (log2(Normalized Read Counts) > 5) in the ribosome profiling data were included for further analysis. Transcripts with less than 50bp were discarded. Only CDS starting with ATG were kept. In cases of multiple in-frame TGG499 codons per transcript, each TGG along the sequence was frameshifted separately. Both +1 and -1 frameshifts at the TGG codon position were implemented. The CDS out-of-frame was in silico translated until the first stop codon. Finally, we generated a database of chimeric polypeptides, starting at the first tryptic cleavage start site, upstream of tryptophan (33628 instances), frame-shifted at TGG codon via both -1 and +1 frameshifts, until out-of-frame stop codons. No further filtering was implemented at the prescanning stage. MS data was analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16). The WT human proteome to run against was obtained from Uniprot database with SWISSPROT protein evidence level of 1. The in-frame protein expression data was further normalized and analyzed using DEP76, For the frame-shift proteome analysis, the MS data was analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16)74 with LFQ normalization, and then was scanned against the trans-frame polypeptide database together with the SWISSPROT proteins with Evidence level of 1. After scanning, a total of 124 peptides from the transframe polypeptide database were retained for further quantitative analysis, after subjecting to filtering for mapping to any proteomic and non-coding sequences. Only the peptides reproducibly detected across replicates were retained for further analysis, and the list included reverse peptide hits (n=41).",
