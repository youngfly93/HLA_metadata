  "projectDescription": "The influence of CD74 expression on the HLA peptidome of the H1 melanoma cell line was analyzed by label-free quantitation mass spectrometry of HLA ligand extracts obtained from CD74 siRNA & control siRNA treated cells.",
  "sampleProcessingProtocol": "HLA class I and class II molecules were isolated from 50Mio CD74siRNA treated and mock treated H1 cells using standard immunoaffinity purification as described previously,(PMID 23329485) . The pan-HLA class I-specific mAb W6/32 was utilized for isolation of Class I molecules. A 1:1 mixture of the pan-HLA class II-specific mAb Tü-39 and the HLA-DR- specific mAB L243 was utilized for the isolation of HLA class  II. Label-free relative quantitation (LFQ) of the HLA peptidome composition was performed by LC-MS analysis of HLA class II ligand extracts from treated and control cells in five technical replicates. Peptide samples were separated by nanoflow high- performance liquid chromatography (RSLCnano, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 50 μm x 25 cm PepMap C18 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a linear gradient ranging from 2.4% to 32.0% acetonitrile over the course of 90 min. Eluting peptides were analyzed in an an online-coupled Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data dependent acquisition mode using collision- induced dissociation fragmentation. MS2 spectra for 2+ and 3+ precursors of 400- 650 m/z were acquired at 30k resolution with AGC target values of 70,000 and maximum injection times of 150ms. Normalized collision energy was set to 35%, dynamic exclusion was set to 7s. On column peptide amounts for the 5 LFQ replicates were adjusted based on initial dose-finding LC-MS analysis.",
  "dataProcessingProtocol": "Database search was performed using SequestHT node of ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4.1.14 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to search against the human proteome as comprised in the Swiss-Prot database (version of September 27 th 2013, 20,279 reviewed protein sequences contained) without enzymatic restriction. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm, fragment mass tolerance to 0.02 Da. Oxidized methionine was allowed as a dynamic modification. The false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated using Percolator (PMID 17952086) and limited to 1%. Peptide lengths were to 8-25 amino acids. Relative quantification of HLA ligands was performed based on the peak area of the corresponding precursor MS1 extracted ion chromatogram. Imputation of missing values, 2-tier normalization for technical variability in MS signal intensity and calculation of fold-change and p-values (heteroskedastic t-test using Benjamini- Hochberg correction) for differential peptide presentation was performed using an in- house R script.",
