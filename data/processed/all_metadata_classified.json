    "description":"HLA class I molecules reflect the health state of cells to cytotoxic T-cells by presenting a repertoire of endogenously derived peptides. However, the extent to which the proteome shapes the peptidome is still largely unknown. Here we present a high-throughput mass-spectrometry-based workflow that allows stringent and accurate identification of thousands of such peptides and direct determination of binding motifs. Applying the workflow to seven cancer cell lines and primary cells, yielded more than 22,000 unique HLA peptides across different allelic binding specificities.  By computing a score representing the HLA-I sampling density, we show a strong link between protein abundance and HLA-presentation (P<0.0001). When analyzing over-presented proteins - those with at least five-fold higher density score than expected for their abundance – we noticed that they are degraded almost 3 hours faster than similar but non-presented proteins (top 20% abundance class; median half-life 20.8h vs. 23.6h, p<0.0001). This validates protein degradation as an important factor for HLA presentation. Ribosomal, mitochondrial respiratory chain and nucleosomal proteins as particularly well presented. Taking a set of proteins associated with cancer, we compared the predicted immunogenicity of previously validated T-cell epitopes with other peptides from these proteins in our dataset. The validated epitopes indeed tend to have higher immunogenic scores than the other detected HLA peptides, suggesting the usefulness of combining MS-analysis with immunogenesis prediction for ranking and selection of epitopes for therapeutic use.",

    "sample_protocol":"Purification of HLA-I complexes. HLA-I peptidomes were obtained from 3-4 biological replicates per cell line. HLA-I complexes were purified from about 5x108 cell pellets after lysis with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Cocktail (Sigma, MO), 1 mM PMSF, 1% octyl-β-D glucopyranoside (Sigma, MO) in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysates were cleared by 30 min centrifugation at 40,000 × g. We immunoaffinity purified HLA-I molecules from cleared lysate with the W6\/32 antibody covalently bound to Protein-A Sepharose beads (Invitrogen, CA), because covalent binding of W6\/32 antibody to the beads improves the purity of the eluted HLA-I complexes, diminishes co-elution of the antibodies which otherwise overload the C-18 cartridges and enables the reuse of the column. This affinity column was washed first with 10 column volumes of 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris•HCl (buffer A), 10 column volumes of 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris•HCl, 10 volumes of buffer A again, and finally with seven column volumes of 20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0. The HLA-I molecules were eluted at room temperature by adding 500 µl of 0.1 N acetic acid, in total 7 elutions for each sample. Small aliquots of each elution fraction were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE to evaluate the yield and purity of the eluted HLA-I. Purification and concentration of HLA-I peptides. Eluted HLA-I peptides and the subunits of the HLA complex were loaded on Sep-Pak tC18 (Waters, MA) cartridges that were pre-washed with 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and with 0.1% TFA only. After loading, the cartridges were washed with 0.1% TFA. The peptides were separated from the much more hydrophobic HLA-I heavy chains on the C18 cartridges by eluting them with 30% ACN in 0.1% TFA. They were further purified using a Silica C-18 column tips (Harvard Apparatus, MA) and eluted again with 30% ACN in 0.1% TFA. The peptides were concentrated and the volume was reduced to 15 µl using vacuum centrifugation. For MS analysis, we used 5 µl of this highly enriched HLA peptides. LC-MS\/MS analysis of HLA-I peptides. HLA peptides were separated by a nanoflow HPLC (Proxeon Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) and coupled on-line to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (31) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems). We packed a 20 cm long, 75 μm inner diameter column with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) in buffer A (0.5% acetic acid). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 2–30% buffer B (80% ACN and 0.5% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 250 nl\/min over 90 min. Data was acquired using a data-dependent ‘top 10’ method, which isolated them and fragment them by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD). We acquired full scan MS spectra at a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m\/z with a target value of 3e6 ions. The ten most intense ions were sequentially isolated and accumulated to an AGC target value of 1e5 with a maximum injection time of generally 120 ms, except in a few cases where we used 250 ms to increase signal of the fragments. In case of unassigned precursor ion charge states, or charge states of four and above, no fragmentation was performed. The peptide match option was disabled. MS\/MS resolution was 17,500 at 200 m\/z. Fragmented m\/z values were dynamically excluded from further selection for 15 or 20 seconds.",
    "data_protocol":"Mass spectrometry data analysis of HLA peptides. We employed the MaxQuant computational proteomics platform (32) version 1.3.10.15. Andromeda, a probabilistic search engine incorporated in the MaxQuant framework (33), was used to search the peak lists against the UniProt database (86,749 entries, June 2012) and a file containing 247 frequently observed contaminants such as human keratins, bovine serum proteins, and proteases. N-terminal acetylation (42.010565 Da) and methionine oxidation (15.994915 Da) were set as variable modifications. The second peptide identification option in Andromeda was enabled. The enzyme specificity was set as unspecific. Andromeda reports the posterior error probability and false discovery rate, which were used for statistical evaluation. A false discovery rate of 0.01 was required for peptides. As we are interested in HLA-I peptide identification rather than the protein identification common in proteomics, no protein false discovery rate was set. Likewise, as no sequence specific proteases are involved and peptides do not terminate in certain amino acids such as Arg or Lys, the special permutation rules in MaxQuant for these amino acids (32) were not used in creating the decoy database. Possible sequence matches were restricted to 8 to 15 a.a., a maximum peptides mass of 1,500 Da and a maximum charge states of three.  The initial allowed mass deviation of the precursor ion was set to 6 ppm and the maximum fragment mass deviation was set to 20 ppm. We enabled the ‘match between runs’ option, which allows matching of identifications across different replicates that belongs to the same cell line, in a time window of 0.5 min and an initial alignment time window of 20 min. From the ‘peptide.txt’ output file produced by MaxQuant, hits to the reverse database and contaminants were eliminated. The resulting list of peptide is provided in Table S1.",

    "description":"Using high­throughput mass spectrometry, we probed the six­reading­frame translation of human B cells’ transcriptome. We report that about 10% of MHC I­associated peptides (MAPs) derive  from non­canonical reading frames. These so­called cryptic MAPs originate from allegedly non- coding genomic sequences and from out­of­frame translation. Their biogenesis and properties  differ in many ways from those of conventional MAPs. Thus, cryptic MAPs come from very  short proteins with atypical C­termini, and they are coded by transcripts bearing long UTRs  selectively enriched in destabilizing elements. Cryptic MAPs increase the complexity of the  immunopeptidome and represent an heretofore unexploited source of potential tumor­specific  epitopes. In a more general context, the features of cryptic MAPs suggest that mRNA instability  is instrumental in the biogenesis of MAPs. Associated RNA-seq accession: GSE67174 .",

    "description":"Although mutations may represent attractive targets for immunotherapy, direct identification of mutated peptide ligands isolated from human leukocyte antigens (HLA) on the surface of native tumor tissue has so far not been successful. Using advanced mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, we survey the melanoma-associated immunopeptidome to a depth of 95,500 patient-presented peptides. We thereby discover a large spectrum of attractive target antigen candidates including cancer testis antigens and phosphopeptides. Most importantly, we identify peptide ligands presented on native tumor tissue samples harboring somatic mutations. Four of eleven mutated ligands prove to be immunogenic by neoantigen-specific T-cell responses. Moreover, tumor-reactive T cells with specificity for selected neoantigens identified by MS are detected in the patient`s tumor and peripheral blood. We conclude that direct identification of mutated peptide ligands from primary tumor material by MS is possible and yields true neoepitopes with high relevance for immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer.",

    "description":"Cancer somatic mutations can generate neoantigens that distinguish malignant from normal cells. Such neoantigens have been implicated in response to immunotherapies including immune checkpoint blockade, yet their identification and validation remains challenging. Here we discover neoantigens in human mantle cell lymphomas using an integrated strategy for genomic and proteomic tumor antigen discovery that interrogates peptides presented within the tumor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules. We applied this approach to systematically identify neoantigen peptides in diagnostic tumor specimens from 17 patients and several cell lines. Remarkably, the discovered neoantigenic peptides were invariably derived from the lymphoma immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy or light chain variable regions. Although we could identify MHC presentation of private germline polymorphic alleles, no mutated peptides were recovered from non-Ig somatically mutated genes. The immunoglobulin variable region somatic mutations were almost exclusively presented by MHC-II. We found T-cells specific for an immunoglobulin-derived neoantigen in the blood of a patient using MHC-II tetramers, and these T-cell clones expanded in frequency following tumor vaccination. These results demonstrate that an integrative approach combining MHC isolation, peptide identification and exome sequencing is an effective platform to uncover tumor neoantigens. Application of this strategy to human lymphoma implicates immunoglobulin neoantigens as targets for lymphoma immunotherapy.",

    "description":"HLA-B*51, the main risk factor for Behçet’s disease (BD), binds two main subpeptidomes consisting of low affinity peptides with Ala as their second amino acid and higher affinity peptides with Pro at this position. A low activity variant of ERAP1, Hap10, is uniquely associated with BD susceptibility in epistasis with HLA-B*51. The peptidome presented by HLA-B*51:08 in a cell line expressing Hap10 was compared with the HLA-B*51:01 peptidome from a cell line expressing higher activity variants of ERAP1. The differences due to ERAP1 could be clearly distinguished from those due to subtype polymorphism. The latter should not affect disease susceptibility, since both HLA-B*51 subtypes are associated with BD. In the lower activity, BD-associated, ERAP1 context longer peptides were generated, the Pro2 subpeptidome was significantly reduced, and the Ala2 subpeptidome was correspondingly increased and showed a higher frequency of ERAP1-susceptible P1 residues. These effects are readily explained by the low activity of the disease-associated Hap10 variant, and together resulted in a significantly altered HLA-B*51 peptidome of lower affinity. The differences between both B*51 subtypes affected residue usage at various internal positions of the peptide ligands, including P3, where B*51:01 showed preference for aromatic residues whereas B*51:08 preferred smaller and polar ones. The profound effects of the BD-associated Hap10 haplotype on the nature and affinity of HLA-B*51\/peptide complexes could significantly alter T-cell and NK cell recognition, providing a basis for the joint association of ERAP1 and HLA-B*51 to BD.",

    "description":"Comprehensive knowledge of the HLA class-I and class-II peptides presented to T-cells is crucial for designing innovative therapeutics against cancer and other diseases. However methodologies for their extraction for mass-spectrometry analysis have been a major limitation. We designed a novel high-throughput, reproducible and sensitive method for sequential extraction of HLA-I and -II peptides from up to 96 samples in a plate format from cell lines or tissues. Our methodology drastically reduces sample-handling and can be completed within six hours. We report identification and quantification of thousands of peptides with excellent reproducibility (Pearson correlations reaching 0.98 and 0.97, class I and II, respectively). Due to improved sensitivity, as many as 1,846 HLA-I and 2,633 HLA-II peptides were accurately identified from only 107 B-cells. We demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug-screening by using ovarian cancer cells treated with interferon gamma. This straightforward method is applicable for basic and clinical applications.",

    "sample_protocol":"For high-throughput HLA-I and HLA-II purification, we employ the Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor (Waters, 186006961) and customized it by adding extended self-made metal rods to accommodate the stacking of up to five 96-well plates. We used for immuno-affinity purifications the 96-well micro-plate with 3Âµm glass fiber and 10Âµm polypropylene membranes which are compatible with the processor and are commercially available (Seahorse Bioscience, 360063).The positive pressure processor was used in each step of the procedure to generate homogenous flow of liquid through the plates.  Preparation of lysates: In the first experimental set-up we purified the HLA-I and II peptidome from JY, CD165, PD42, CM467, RA957, TIL1 and TIL3. Cell lysis was performed with PBS containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich, 30970), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, I6125), 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 04693132001), 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Roche, 329-98-6), 1% octyl-beta-D glucopyranoside (Sigma-Alrich, 08001) at 4°C for 1 hour.  In general, lysis buffer was added to the cells at a concentration of 1 x 108 cells\/mL. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation with a table-top centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge, 5430R) at 4°C at 14200 rpm for 50 min. For each cell line, lysate from a total of 3 x 108 cells were pooled and evenly distributed as 1 x 108 triplicates into designated wells. In a second experimental set-up, snap-frozen meningioma tissue samples were placed in tubes containing ice cold lysis buffer (mentioned above) and homogenized on ice in 3-5 short intervals of 5 seconds each using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (IKA, T10 standard) with maximum speed. For one gram of tissue, 10 mL of lysis buffer was required. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm in a high speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, JSS15314) at 4°C for 50 minutes. To test the limits of sensitivity with our method, we extracted HLA-I and -II peptides from 10, 30, 50 and 70 million cells as described above and we split the lysate of 1.3 x 108 CD165 B-cells proportionally to the desired cell amount; this was performed in triplicates. Last, four replicates of 1.5 x 108 UWB.1 289 cells untreated and four replicates treated with IFNy were processed separately but in parallel for HLAp extraction. Preparation of plates: First, empty platesâ€™ wells were washed and equilibrated with 1 ml of 100% acetonitrile (ACN; Sigma-Aldrich, 34967), followed by 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid wash (TFA; Merck Millipore, 1082620100)  and last with 2 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15568025). Anti-pan HLA-I and HLA-II antibodies cross-linked to beads were loaded on their respective plates (named â€œHLA Iâ€ and â€œHLA IIâ€, see Figure 1 and Supplementary Video 1) at a final bead volume of 75 uL in 0.1 M Tris-HCl. For tissue samples, a depletion step of endogenous antibodies was required. Therefore, an additional plate (named â€œPre-clearâ€ plate) with wells containing 100 uL Pro-A beads was prepared. The beads alone or antibodies cross-linked to beads were conditioned with lysis buffer before lysate loading. Purification of HLA-I and HLA-II peptides: Two Sep-Pak tC18 96-well plates (Waters, 186002321) were required for the purification and concentration of HLA-I and HLA-II peptides. Each Sep-Pak plate was handled separately. Firstly, we conditioned the plates with 1 mL of 80% ACN in 0.1 % TFA and then with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA. The affinity plate was stacked on top of the C18 plate to achieve direct elution of the HLA complexes and the bound peptides with 500 uL 1% TFA. This is followed by washing the Sep-Pak wells with 2 mL of 0.1 % TFA. Thereafter we eluted the HLA-I peptides with 500 uL of 28% ACN in 0.1% TFA. HLA-II peptides were eluted from the class II Sep-Pak plate with 500 uL of 32% ACN in 0.1% TFA. Both HLA-I and -II peptides elutions were transferred into eppendorf tubes. Recovered HLA-I and -II peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, N09Y-442492-NY) and stored at -20C. Dry peptides were resuspended in a designated volume prior to injection into the mass spectrometry.",
    "data_protocol":"We employed the MaxQuant computational proteomics platform version 1.5.5.1 4 to search the peak lists against the UniProt databases (Human 42,148 entries, March 2017) and a file containing 247 frequently observed contaminants. N-terminal acetylation (42.010565 Da) and methionine oxidation (15.994915 Da) were set as variable modifications. The second peptide identification option in Andromeda was enabled. A false discovery rate of 0.01 and no protein false discovery rate was set for peptidomics analysis while a protein FDR of 0.01 was set for proteomic analysis. The enzyme specificity was set as unspecific for peptidomics analysis, while C-term specificity for K and R, and max 2 miscleavages were chosen for analysis of proteomics samples. Possible sequence matches were restricted to 8 to 25 amino acids, a maximum peptides mass of 4600 Da. The initial allowed mass deviation of the precursor ion was set to 6 ppm and the maximum fragment mass deviation was set to 20 ppm. We enabled the â€˜match between runsâ€™ option, which allows matching of identifications across different replicates of the same biological sample in a time window of 0.5 min and an initial alignment time window of 20 min.

They encode for a class of instable peptides, which evade experimental validation by whole-proteome mass spectrometry. Here, we show that computational elimination of experimental noise from Ribo-seq data unravels fundamental new aspects of sORF biology. Based on the revised annotation of cellular sORFs, we show that sORF-derived peptides are efficiently incorporated into MHC-I. sORFs thus encode a novel class of stress-responsive antigens in human cells.

    "title":"MHC peptides presentation is limited by availability of empty HLA molecules rather than the supply of peptides ligands",
    "description":"Whether the presentation levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, called the human leukocytes antigens, HLA, in humans) is limited by the availability of peptide ligands for loading or by the supply of empty MHC molecules, is a yet unresolved issue. This study aims to tackle this dilemma using large-scale immunopeptidome analyses. First, cultured cells (MCF-7) were treated with interferons, which dramatically increased presentation levels of their HLA-B molecules, much more than HLA-A and HLA-C. The differential increase in the HLA-B molecules with their bound peptides, was driven by elevated HLA synthesis levels and not by supply of peptides, since all three HLA allotypes draw peptides from the same peptide pool, which should have been affected similarly by the interferons treatment. In addition, artificial competition for peptides was created by recombinant high levels expression of soluble HLA-A*02:01 molecules, in the same MCF-7 cells and on top of their endogenous membranal HLA-A*02:01. This high level expression of the soluble HLA did not affect the endogenous membranal HLA-A*02:01 peptidomes or its cell surface presentation levels. We therefore concluded that a surplus supply of peptides is available for loading and that presentation levels are more likely limited by the supply of HLA molecules.",

    "sample_protocol":"Membranal HLA (mHLA) class I molecules were purified from about 5x108 cells, lysed with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1 mM PMSF and 1% octyl-β-D glucopyranoside (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS at 4°C for 1 hour. The cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 45 minutes at 47,580g at 4°C. The HLA class I molecules were immunoaffinity purified using the W6\/32 mAb bound to Amino-Link beads (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) or the BB7.2 mAb bound to protein A-resin beads (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). The HLA molecules with their bound peptides were eluted from the affinity column with five column volumes of 0.1% TFA. The eluted HLA class I proteins and the released peptides were loaded on disposable C18 columns (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and the peptides fraction was recovered with 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA and the HLA co-immunoaffinity purified proteins (Interactome) were recovered with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The peptides and immunoaffinity purified proteins fractions were dried using vacuum centrifugation. The HLA peptides were reconstituted in 100μl of 0.1% TFA, reloaded on C18 StageTips, eluted with 80% acetonitrile, dried and reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid for µLC-MS\/MS analysis. Soluble HLA class I (sHLA) molecules were immunoaffinity purified from the cleared culture medium using the BB7.2 mAb,eluted as describes for the membranal HLA class I molecules and analyzed using μLC-MS\/MS. The purification of the mHLA and sHLA molecules from the un-transfected and transfected cells, using the BB7.2 mAb were performed in two biological replicas. The HLA peptidome analyses using the W6\/32 mAb was carried out in three biological replicas, of IFN-β or IFN-γ treated cells, and with four biological replica for the untreated\/control cells. Proteomics analysis and HLA-interacting proteins:An in-gel proteolysis of 5 gel slices from each lane of 30 µg of the total cell proteins of the standard MCF-7 cells was carried out. In addition, the proteins co-purifying with the HLA molecules from the immunoaffinity columns (the interactome) were dried by vacuum centrifugations, resuspended in ammonium bicarbonate and trypsinized in-solution, followed by resolution of the peptides by reversed phase capillary chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The in-gel proteolysis assay was performed once, while the Interactome was carried out in three biological replicas, of the IFNs treated cells, and with four biological replica of the untreated cells. Identification of HLA peptides and of tryptic peptides: The HLA and the tryptic peptides from the proteomics assays were resolved by capillary chromatography and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry by a Q-Exactive-Plus mass spectrometer fitted with Easy nLC 1000 capillary HPLC (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) or with an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano-capillary UHPLC (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). The reversed phase capillary chromatographies were performed with home-packed capillary column of about 30 cm long, 75 μm inner diameter column with 3.5 μm silica ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). HLA peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 5-28% of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, at a flow rate of 0.15 μl\/min for 2 hours. Data was acquired using a data-dependent “top 10” method, fragmenting the peptides by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). Full scan MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m\/z with a target value of 3x106 ions. Fragmented masses were accumulated to AGC (automatic gain control) target value of 105 with a maximum injection time of generally 100 msec. For the HLA peptides with unassigned precursor ion charge states, or charge states of four and above, no fragmentation was performed. The peptide match option was set to Preferred. Normalized collision energy was set to 25% and MS\/MS resolution was 17,500 at 200 m\/z. Fragmented m\/z values were dynamically excluded from further selection for 20 seconds. The recovered tryptic peptides from the interactome assay were analyzed by the LTQ OrbitrapXL mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) fitted with a capillary HPLC (Eksigent, CA, USA). The peptides were resolved using a linear gradient of 7-40% of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate of the gradient program was 0.25 μl\/min for 2 hours. Each full MS was followed by MS\/MS of the top seven most intense precursor ions using collision-induced disintegration (CID). Tryptic peptides of 2-5 charge state were selected for fragmentation according to the following conditions: Exclusion time was set to 30 sec, the AGC was set to target value of 5×105 ions for the full scan MS and for 1×104 ions for MS-MS, the MS resolution was set to 60000 and the normalized collision energy was set to 35.",

Peptide identifications were based on the human section of the Uniprot database (http:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/) of November 2014 containing 88,812 entries, except for the HLA-A2 peptides that were identified using the Uniprot database of April 2017, containing 70,946 entries. Mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm for the precursor masses and 20 ppm for the fragments were allowed. Methionine oxidation was accepted as variable modification for both tryptic and HLA peptides. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was accepted as a fixed modification for the proteomics data and as a variable modification for the HLA peptidome data. Methionine sulfoxide and n-acetylation were set as variable modifications for both the proteomics and HLA peptidomics analyses. Minimal peptide length was set to seven amino acids and a maximum of two miscleavages was allowed for tryptic peptides. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set for tryptic peptides to 0.01 and 0.05 for the HLA peptides. The resulting identified protein tables were filtered to eliminate the identifications derived from the reverse database, as well as common contaminants. Peptides were defined as significantly changed in their levels in the treated cells relative to the untreated cells using a T-test, performed by the Perseus software.

    "title":"Allele-specific alterations in the peptidome underlie the joint association of HLA-A*29:02 and Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) with Birdshot Chorioretinopathy",
    "description":"Birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR) is a rare inflammatory eye disease very strongly associated with HLA-A*29:02, with >95% of patients carrying this allele. BSCR is also associated with endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP)2, an enzyme involved in processing HLA class I ligands. We analyzed the relationship between both risk factors, to address the basis for their joint association with BSCR. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry was used to characterize the effects of ERAP2 on the A*29:02-bound peptidome. An ERAP2-negative cell line was transduced with lentiviral constructs containing GFP or GFP-ERAP2, and the A*29:02 peptidomes from mock- and ERAP2-transduced cells were compared. A similar analysis was performed with two A*29:02-positive, ERAP1-concordant, cell lines differing in their expression or not of ERAP2. In both comparisons the presence of ERAP2 affected the following features of the A*29:02 peptidome: 1) Length, with increased amounts of peptides >9-mers, and 2) N-terminal residues, with less ERAP2-susceptible and more hydrophobic ones. The paradoxical effects on peptide length suggest that unproductive binding to ERAP2 might protect some peptides from over-trimming. The influence on N-terminal residues is consistent with a double effect of ERAP2: a direct one on peptide trimming and improved processing in concert with ERAP1. The alterations in the A*29:02 peptidome suggest that the association of ERAP2 with BSCR is through its effects on peptide processing.  These differ from those on the ankylosing spondylitis-associated HLA-B*27. Thus, ERAP2 alters the peptidome of distinct HLA molecules as a function of their specific binding preferences, influencing different pathological outcomes in an allele-dependent way.",

    "title":"Identification of tumor antigens among the HLA peptidomes of Glioblastoma tumors and plasma",
    "description":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis to most patients. Immunotherapy of GBM is a potentially beneficial treatment option, whose optimal implementation may depend on familiarity with tumor specific antigens, presented as HLA peptides by the GBM cells. Furthermore, early detection of GBM, such as by a routine blood test, may improve survival, even with the current treatment modalities. This study includes large-scale analyses of the HLA peptidome (immunopeptidome) of the plasma-soluble HLA molecules (sHLA) of 142 plasma samples and the membranal HLA of GBM tumors of 10 tumor samples of the same patients. Tumor samples were fresh-frozen immediately after surgery and plasma samples were collected before, and at multiple visits after surgery. In total, this HLA peptidome analysis involved 52 different HLA allotypes and resulted in the identification of more than 35,000 different HLA peptides. Strong correlations were observed in the signal intensities and in the repertoires of identified peptides between the tumors and plasma-soluble HLA peptidomes of the same patients; yet, low correlations were observed between these HLA peptidomes and the tumors’ proteomes. HLA peptides derived from Cancer\/Testis Antigens (CTAs) were selected based on their presence among the HLA peptidomes of the patients and absence of expression of their source genes from any healthy and essential human tissues, except from immune-privileged sites. Additionally, peptides were selected as potential biomarkers if their levels in the plasma-sHLA peptidome were significantly reduced after the removal of tumor mass. The CTAs identified among the analyzed HLA peptidomes provide new opportunities for personalized immunotherapy and for early diagnosis of GBM.",

    "sample_protocol":"Membranal HLA class I molecules were purified from GBM tumor tissues by immunoaffinity from the cells after lysis with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Mixture (Sigma), 1 mM PMSF, and 1% octyl-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma) in PBS at 4 °C for 1 hour. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 45 min at 18,000 rpm, at 4 °C. HLA class I molecules from the cleared lysate or from the fresh human plasma were immunoaffinity purified using the W6\/32 mAb bound to Amino-Link beads (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The HLA molecules with their bound peptides were eluted from the affinity column with five column volumes of 1% TFA. The eluted HLA class I proteins, and the released peptides were loaded on disposable C18 micro-columns (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and the peptides fraction was recovered with 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA, while the protein fraction was recovered with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The peptide fractions were dried using vacuum centrifugation, reconstituted in 100 μl of 0.1% TFA, reloaded on C18 Stage-Tips, eluted with 80% acetonitrile, dried, and reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid for LC-MS\/MS analysis.  Proteomics analysis was performed after trypsin digestion of the proteins in gel slices. Briefly, 40 microgram protein from each tissue was ran in 10% acrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie, and each lane of the gel was sliced into five slices. The proteins in the gel slices were reduced with 2.8 mM DTT at 60 °C for 30 min and carbamidomethylated with 8.8 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature for 30 min and digested overnight at 37 °C in 10% acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate with modified trypsin (Promega) at a 1:10 (wt\/wt) enzyme-to-substrate ratio. This was repeated for another 4 hours with a similar amount of trypsin, followed by 150 min gradients of LC-MS\/MS of the tryptic peptides from each gel slice.  Identification of the HLA and tryptic peptides: Both the HLA and tryptic peptides were resolved by capillary chromatography and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using a Q-Exactive-Plus mass spectrometer fitted with a capillary Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano-capillary UHPLC (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). The reversed phase capillary chromatographs were 30 cm long, 75 micron inner diameter columns, home-packed with 3.5 m silica ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). HLA and tryptic peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5–28% of acetonitrile in 0.1% Formic acid. For both the HLA peptides and for the in-gel digested fractions, the Capillary HPLC gradients were run at flow rates of 0.15 µl\/minutes during 120 min. Data was acquired using a data-dependent “top 10” method, fragmenting the peptides by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). Full scan MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m\/z with a target value of 3*106 ions. MS\/MS ions were accumulated to an AGC target value of 105 with a maximum injection time of 100 msec. For the HLA peptides with unassigned precursor ion charge states, or charge states of four and above, no fragmentation was performed. For tryptic peptides, the fragmentation was performed on charge states between 2 to 7. The peptide match option was set to Preferred. Normalized collision energy was set to 25% and MS\/MS resolution was 17,500 at 200 m\/z. Fragmented m\/z values were dynamically excluded from further selection for 20 seconds.",
    "data_protocol":"Data Analysis: The MS data was analyzed by the MaxQuant computational proteomics platform version 1.5.3.8 and searched with the Andromeda search engine. Peptide identifications were based on the human section of the Uniprot database (http:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/) of July 2015 containing 69,693 entries. Proteins were declared positive identification with at least two identified tryptic peptides per protein. Mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm for the precursor masses and 20 ppm for the fragments were allowed. Methionine oxidation was accepted as variable modification for both tryptic and HLA peptides. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was accepted as a fixed modification for the proteomics data and as a variable modification for the HLA peptidome data. Methionine sulfoxide and n-acetylation were set as variable modifications for both the proteomics and HLA peptidomics analyses. Minimal peptide length was set to seven amino acids and a maximum of two miscleavages was allowed for tryptic peptides. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set for tryptic peptides to 0.01 for protein identifications, and 0.05 for the HLA peptides. The resulting identified protein tables were filtered to eliminate the identifications derived from the reverse database, as well as common contaminants.  Normalization of the HLA peptidome and proteome Data: The HLA peptidome of each of the LC-MS\/MS runs was normalized according to its median. The medians were zeroed, and down-regulated HLA peptides were defined as those changing by at least two folds in the plasma samples collected immediately before surgery relative to samples collected at later clinic visits. The proteome LC-MS\/MS data was normalized using the LFQ and iBAQ tools of the MaxQuant software.",

MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.",

Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.",

MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.",

Then, 550 µl of ice-cold 10X lysis buffer (10% w\/v CHAPS) was added to each sample. After 60 minute incubation with tumbling at 4°C, samples were spun at 10000g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred into new tubes containing magnetic beads coupled to W6\/32 antibodies. Samples were incubated with tumbling for 180 minutes at 4°C and placed on a magnet to recover bound MHC I complexes to magnetic beads.  Magnetic beads were first washed with 8 × 1 mL PBS, then with 1 × 1 mL of 0.1X PBS and finally with 1 × 1 mL of water. MHC I complexes were eluted from the magnetic beads by acidic treatment using 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).  Eluates were transferred into 2.0 mL Costar mL Spin-X centrifuge tube filters and spun 2 minutes at 3000g. Filtrates containing peptides were separated from MHC I subunits using home-made stage tips packed with twenty 1 mm diameter octadecyl (C-18) solid phase extraction disks (EMPORE). Stage tips were pre-washed first with methanol then with 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.2% TFA and finally with 0.1% formic acid (FA). Samples were loaded and then washed with 0.1% FA. Peptides were eluted with 30% ACN in 0.1%TFA, dried using vacuum centrifugation and then stored at -20°C. MAP extracts were loaded on a home-made C18 analytical column (15 cm x 150 𝜇m i.d. packed with C18 Jupiter Phenomenex) with a 100-min gradient from 5–28 % acetonitrile (0.2 % formic acid) and a 600 nl.min-1 flow rate on a nEasy-LC II system. Each full MS spectrum, acquired with a 60,000 resolution, was followed by 20 MS\/MS spectra, where the most abundant multiply charged ions were selected for MS\/MS sequencing with a resolution of 30,000, an automatic gain control target of 5e4, an injection time of 100 ms and a collision energy of 25 %.",

    "description":"HLA-I molecules bind short peptides and present them to CD8+ T cells for TCR recognition. The length of HLA-I ligands typically ranges from 8 to 12 amino acids, but high variability is observed between different alleles. Here we used recent HLA peptidomics data to analyze in an unbiased way peptide length distributions over 85 different HLA-I alleles. Our results revealed clear clustering of HLA-I alleles with distinct peptide length distributions, which enabled us to unravel some of the molecular basis of peptide length distributions and predict peptide length distributions based on HLA-I sequences only. We further took advantage of our collection of curated HLA peptidomics studies to investigate multiple specificity in HLA-I molecules and validated these observations with binding assays. Explicitly modeling peptide length distributions and multiple specificity significantly improved predictions of naturally presented HLA-I ligands, as demonstrated in an independent benchmarking based on ten newly generated HLA peptidomics datasets from meningioma samples.",

    "sample_protocol":"Snap frozen meningioma tissues from patients were obtained from the Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois (CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland). HLA-I typing was performed for all samples (see Table S1). Informed consent of the participants was obtained following requirements of the institutional review board (Ethics Commission, CHUV). Protocol F-25\/99 has been approved by the local Ethics committee and the biobank of the Lab of Brain Tumor Biology and Genetics.   We extracted HLA-I peptides from the meningioma samples as previously described (ref MCP). Briefly, snap-frozen meningioma tissue samples were placed in tubes containing ice cold PBS lysis buffer comprising of 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 1% octyl-beta-D glucopyranoside (Sigma-Alrich) and homogenized on ice in 3-5 short intervals of 5 seconds each using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany) at maximum speed. Cell lysis was performed at 4°C for 1 hour. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm in a high speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, JSS15314, Nyon, Switzerland) at 4°C for 50 minutes. The lysates were loaded on stacked 96-well single-use micro-plates (3µm glass fiber, 10µm polypropylene membranes; ref number 360063, Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, Massachusetts). The first plate contained protein-A sepharose 4B (Pro-A) beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) for depletion of antibodies, and the second plate contained same beads cross-linked to W6\/32 anti HLA monoclonal antibodies as previously described (ref MCP). We then employed the Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor (Waters, Milford, Massachusetts). We washed the second plate with 4 times 2 mL of 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) (Carlo-Erba, Val de Reuil, France) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 4 times 2 mL of 400 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and again with 4 times 2 mL of 150 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Finally, we washed the beads twice with 2 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. We stacked the affinity plate on top of a Sep-Pak tC18 100 mg Sorbent 96-well plate (ref number: 186002321, Waters) already equilibrated with 1 mL of 80% ACN in 0.1 % TFA and with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA. We eluted the HLA and peptides with 500 µL 1% TFA into the Sep-Pak plate and then we washed this plate with 2 mL of 0.1 % TFA. Thereafter, we eluted the HLA-I peptides with 500 µL of 28% ACN in 0.1% TFA into a collection plate. Recovered HLA-I peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator plus Eppendorf) and stored at -20°C.  Prior to MS analysis HLA-I peptide samples were re-suspended in 10 µL of 2% ACN in 0.1 % FA  and aliquots of 3 ul  for each MS run were placed in the Ultra HPLC autosampler. All samples were acquired using the nanoflow Ultra-HPLC Easy nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, LC140) coupled online to a Q Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Sonation, PRSO-V1,  Baden-Württemberg, Germany) as previously described (ref MCP).

Mounted analytical columns were kept at 50°C using a column oven. Data was acquired with data-dependent “top10” method. The MS scan range was set to 300 to 1,650 m\/z with a resolution of 60,000 (200 m\/z) and an AGC target value of 3e6 ions. For MS\/MS, AGC target values of 1e5 were used with a maximum injection time of 120 ms at set resolution of 15,000 (200 m\/z).

    "description":"Anti-leukemia immunity plays an important role for disease control and maintenance of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-free remission in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Antigen-specific immunotherapy holds promise to strengthen immune control in CML, but requires the identification of CML-associated targets. In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify naturally presented HLA class I- and class II-presented peptides in 20 primary CML samples. Comparative HLA ligandome profiling using a comprehensive dataset of different hematological benign specimen delineated a novel panel of frequently expressed CML-exclusive peptides. These non-mutated target antigens are of particular relevance since our extensive data-mining approach demonstrated absence of naturally presented BCR-ABL- and ABL-BCR-derived HLA-presented peptides and the lack of frequent tumor-exclusive presentation of predescribed cancer\/testis and leukemia-associated antigens. Functional characterization revealed spontaneous T-cell responses against the newly identified CML-associated peptides in CML patients and their ability to de novo induce multifunctional and cytotoxic antigen-specific T cells in healthy volunteers and CML patients. This characterizes these antigens as prime candidates for T cell-based immunotherapy approaches that may prolong TKI-free survival and even mediate cure of CML patients.",

    "title":"Editing the immunopeptidome of melanoma cells using a potent inhibitor of ER aminopeptidase 1",
    "description":"The efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, including treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, is often limited by ineffective presentation of antigenic peptides that can elicit T-cell mediated anti-tumor cytotoxic responses. Therefore, manipulating antigen presentation is an emerging approach for enhancing the immunogenicity of tumors in immunotherapy settings. ER aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) is an intracellular enzyme that trims peptides that can bind onto MHC class I molecules (MHC-I). We hypothesized that pharmacologically inhibiting ERAP1 in cells can regulate the global cellular immunopeptidome. To test this hypothesis, we treated the A375 melanoma cell line with a recently developed potent ERAP1 inhibitor and analyzed the presented MHC-I peptide repertoire by isolating MHC-I, eluting the bound peptides and identifying them using capillary chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Although the inhibitor did not negatively affect overall MHC-I presence on the cell surface, it induced significant changes on the presented peptidomes, both at the qualitative and quantitative levels. Specifically, inhibitor treatment altered about half of the total 3204 identified peptides and about one third of the peptides predicted to be good ligands for MHC-I, affected length and sequence without however interfering with basic binding motifs. Strikingly, the inhibitor enhanced overall MHC-I binding affinity by reducing presentation of sub-optimal long peptides and generating many high-affinity 9-12mers, suggesting that baseline ERAP1 activity in this cell line is destructive for many potential epitopes. Our results suggest that chemical inhibition of ERAP1 is a valid approach for manipulating the immunopeptidome of cancer and autoimmunity.",

    "sample_protocol":"Preparation of immunoaffinity columns    W6\/32 antibody (2mg per column) was dialyzed in coupling buffer (NaHCO3 0.1M, NaCl 0.5M pH 8.3) overnight. To generate one 1ml bed volume of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare 17-0430-01) 0.285g of dry beads were weighted. The Sepharose was moisturized with 1mM HCl for 30min and then washed thoroughly with coupling buffer. The solution of the antibody was added to the beads and left for coupling overnight at 4°C. After coupling, the beads were washed with coupling buffer and then with blocking buffer (Tris-HCl 0.1M, pH 8.0). After the washes the beads were transferred to a 50ml tube with blocking buffer and were mixed for 3h at room temperature. Finally, the beads were washed with 3 cycles of acidic (CH3COONa 0.1M, NaCl 0.5M, pH 4.0) and basic (Tris-HCl 0.1M, NaCl 0.5M, pH 8.0) buffer and then with 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl. For the pre-columns the exact same procedure was followed with the exception of the W6\/32 coupling step. The columns and the pre-columns were stored at 4°C until needed.        Isolation of MHCI immunopeptidome   For the isolation of the immunopeptidome 5x108 cells per sample were used.

    "description":"The endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases ERAP1 and ERAP2 trim peptides to be loaded onto HLA molecules, including the main risk factor for Behçet’s disease HLA-B*51. ERAP1 is also a risk factor among HLA-B*51-positive individuals, whereas no association is known with ERAP2. This study addressed the mutual relationships between both enzymes in the processing of an HLA-bound peptidome, interrogating their differential association with Behçet’s disease. CRISPR\/Cas9 was used to generate knock outs of ERAP1, ERAP2 or both from transfectant 721.221-HLA-B*51:01 cells. The surface expression of HLA-B*51 was reduced in all cases. The effects of depleting each or both enzymes on the B*51:01 peptidome were analyzed by quantitative label-free mass spectrometry. Substantial quantitative alterations of peptide length, subpeptidome balance, N-terminal residue usage, affinity and presentation of non-canonical ligands were observed. These effects were often different in the presence or absence of the other enzyme, revealing their mutual dependency. In the absence of ERAP1, ERAP2 showed similar and significant processing of B*51:01 ligands, indicating functional redundancy. The high overlap between the peptidomes of wildtype and double KO cells indicates that a large majority of B*51:01 ligands are present in the ER even in the absence of ERAP1\/ERAP2. These results indicate that both enzymes have distinct, but complementary and partially redundant effects on the B*51:01 peptidome, leading to its optimization and maximal surface expression. The distinct effects of both enzymes on the HLA-B*51 peptidome provide a basis for their differential association with Behçet’s disease and suggest a pathogenetic role of the B*51:01 peptidome.",

In the orbitrap, survey scans of peptides with 400-650 m\/z as well as 2+ and 3+ as permitted charge states were recorded at a resolution of 60,000 with subsequent selection of the five most abundant precursor ions for collision-induced dissociation (CID). The normalized collision energy was set to 35, activation time to 30 ms and the isolation width to 2.0 m\/z. MS\/MS spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap (LTQ) and corresponding precursor ions were dynamically excluded for 3 s after fragmentation.   Alternatively, an online coupled Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) was used. In the Orbitrap, survey scans of precursor ions (HCC025: 320-670 m\/z, HCC026: 300-650 m\/z; 2+ and 3+ as permitted charge states) were recorded at a resolution of 120,000 with subsequent selection for collision-induced dissociation (CID).

In addition to PRM tandem MS2 measurements targeting two mutated antigens with evidence on proteome level (PNE Prot ; ALB K375E in HCC025 and RECQL H19R in HCC026), we performed one top n run in DDA mode (HCC025: 320-670 m\/z, HCC026: 300-650 m\/z) per sample. In the Orbitrap, survey scans of precursor ions (HCC025: 320-670 m\/z, HCC026: 300-650 m\/z; 2+ and 3+ as permitted charge states) were recorded at a resolution of 120,000 with subsequent selection for CID.

Separation was performed using a linear 130 min gradient of 5-33 % solvent B (80 % ACN in 0.5 % acetic acid). Each of four samples was run as one technical replicate. LTQ Orbitrap Elite was operated in the positive ion mode. Precursor ions were acquired in the mass range from 300 to 2,000 m\/z followed by MS\/MS spectra acquisition of the 20 most intense precursor ions.

Database search was carried out without enzymatic restriction and oxidation of methionine residues as the only dynamic modification (maximal number of modifications per peptide set to 3). The digest mass range was set to 800-2,500. Precursor charge was fixed to 2-3 and the precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm. In addition, a fragment bin tolerance of 1.0 Da and a fragment bin offset of 0.4 Da was set and neutral losses were included for each peptide spectrum match (PSM). A 5 % PSM FDR threshold was calculated using Percolator, based on a competitive target-decoy approach using reversed decoy sequences and merged identifications of all replicate runs if available.

Protein N-terminal acetylation as well as oxidation of methionine residues were selected as variable modifications, whereas carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as fixed modification. TrypsinP was selected as enzyme with specific digestion mode. Further, we specified the match type as MatchFromAndTo and set the number of MaxMissedCleavages to two. Requantification and matching between runs were enabled. As a reference, we specified the Swiss-Prot reviewed human proteome (version UP000005640, derived: 02\/16\/2016).",

    "description":"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) - B*51:01 and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) are two strong predisposing genetic factors to Behçet's disease (BD). Previous studies have focused on two subgroups of HLA-B*51 peptidome containing Proline (Pro) or Alanine (Ala) at position 2 (P2). Little is known about the unconventional non-Pro\/Ala2 HLA-B*51-bound peptides. We aimed to study the features of this novel sub-peptidome, and investigate its regulation by ERAP1. CRISPR-Cas9 was used to generate an HLA-ABC-knockout HeLa cell line (HeLa.ABC-KO), which was subsequently transduced to express HLA-B*51:01 (HeLa.ABC-KO.B51). ERAP1 was silenced using lentiviral shRNA. Peptides bound to HLA-B*51:01 were eluted and analyzed by Mass Spectrometry. The characteristics of non-Pro\/Ala2, Pro2 and Ala2 peptides, and their alteration by ERAP1 silencing were investigated. Effects of ERAP1 silencing on cell surface expression of HLA-B*51:01 were studied using flow cytometry. More than 20% of peptides eluted from HLA-B*51:01 lacked Proline or Alanine at P2. This unconventional group of HLA-B*51:01-bound peptides was enriched for 8-mers (with fewer 9-mers) compared to Pro2 and Ala2 sub-peptidomes, and had similar N-terminal and C-terminal residue usages to Ala2 peptides with the exception of the less abundant Leucine at position Ω. Knockdown of ERAP1 increased the percentage of non-Pro\/Ala2 to approximately 40%, increased the percentage of longer (10-mer and 11-mer) peptides eluted from HLA-B*51:01 complexes, and abrogated the predominance of Leucine at P1. Interestingly knockdown of ERAP1 altered the length and N-terminal residue usage of non-Ala2&Pro2 and Ala2 but not the Pro2 peptides. Finally, ERAP1 silencing regulated the expression levels of cell surface HLA-B*51 in a cell type - dependent manner. The HLA-B*51:01 peptidome includes a surprisingly high proportion of unconventional non-Pro\/Ala2 peptides which are increased by ERAP1 silencing, mimicking the loss-of-function BD risk variant.",

Here, we present a novel MS-based analytical pipeline that can precisely characterize the non-canonical HLAp repertoire, incorporating whole exome sequencing, bulk and single cell transcriptomics, ribosome profiling, and a combination of two MS\/MS search tools. This approach results in the accurate identification of hundreds of shared and tumor-specific non-canonical HLAp. Albeit often at low levels and in distinct subpopulations of cells, numerous non-canonical HLAp are shared across tumors. This analytical platform holds great promise for the discovery of novel cancer antigens for cancer immunotherapy.",

    "sample_protocol":"Immunoaffinity purification of HLA peptides We performed HLA immunoaffinity purification following our previously established protocols40,66.  Briefly, W6\/32 and HB145 monoclonal antibodies were purified from the supernatant of HB95 (ATCC® HB-95™) and HB145 cells (ATCC® HB-145™) using protein-A sepharose 4B (Pro-A) beads (Invitrogen), and antibodies were then cross-linked to Pro-A beads. Cell lysis was performed with PBS containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Roche), 1% octyl-beta-D glucopyranoside (Sigma-Alrich) at 4°C for 1 hour.  Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at maximum speed for 50 min. Snap-frozen tissue samples were homogenized on ice in 3-5 short intervals of 5 seconds each using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (IKA) at maximum speed. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm in a high speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, JSS15314) at 4°C for 50 minutes. We employed the Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor (Waters) and 96-well single-use micro-plates with 3µm glass fiber and 10µm polypropylene membranes (Seahorse Bioscience, ref no: 360063). Anti-pan HLA-I and HLA-II antibodies cross-linked to beads were loaded on their respective plates. For tissue samples, a depletion step of endogenous antibodies was required containing Pro-A beads. The lysates were passed sequentially through HLA-I and -II plates at 4°C. Plates were then washed separately with varying concentrations of salts using the processor. Finally, beads were washed twice with 2 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Sep-Pak tC18 100 mg Sorbent 96-well plates (Waters, ref no: 186002321) were used for the purification and concentration of HLA-I and HLA-II peptides. Plates were conditioned and direct elution of the HLA complexes and the bound peptides from the affinity plate with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Sigma-Aldrich) was performed. After washing the C18 wells with 2 mL of 0.1 % TFA, HLA-I peptides were eluted with 28% Acetonitrile (ACN; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1% TFA. HLA-II peptides were eluted from the class II C18 plate with 500 µL of 32% ACN in 0.1% TFA. Recovered HLA-I and -II peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator plus, Eppendorf) and stored at -20°C.  LC-MS\/MS analyses The LC-MS\/MS system consists of an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) hyphenated with a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 450 mm analytical column of 75 µm inner diameter. The analytical separation was run for 120 min using a gradient of H2O\/ CH2O2 (FA; Sigma-Aldrich) 99.9 %\/0.1 % and CH3CN\/ CH2O2 80 %\/0.1 % (solvent B). The gradient was run as follows: 0 min 2% B, then to 5% B at 5 min, 35% B at 85 min, 60% B at 100 min, and 95% B at 105 min at a flow rate of 250 nL\/min. The mass spectrometer was operated as follows for discovery data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Full MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap from m\/z = 300-1650 with a resolution of 60’000 (m\/z = 200) and ion accumulation time of 80 ms. The autogain control (AGC) was set to 3e6 ions. MS\/MS spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner on 10 most abundant precursor ions (if present) with a resolution of 15’000(m\/z = 200), ion accumulation time of 120 ms and an isolation window of 1.2 m\/z. The AGC was set to 2e5 ions, dynamic exclusion to 20 s and a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27 was used for fragmentation.",
    "data_protocol":"Mass Spectrometry Database Search  We used two widely used search tools: Comet35 and the Andromeda search engine within MaxQuant v1.5.9.4i76. Both Andromeda and Comet provided good results in preliminary tests, their scoring methods performed well for HLAp peptides, and they allowed searching for peptides with and without variants. Andromeda matched the MS\/MS spectra of each sample against their personalized reference libraries (mentioned above). Similarly, the variants were annotated in the PEFF format (http:\/\/www.psidev.info\/peff) for Comet. Both search tools were run with the same principal search parameters: precursor mass tolerance 20ppm, MS\/MS fragment tolerance 0.02 Da, peptide length 8-15 for HLA-I only and 8-25 for HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) as variable modifications and no fixed modifications. A PSM FDR of 3% was used for Andromeda as a first filter, and nonc reference sequences were loaded into the “proteogenomics fasta files” module for separate FDR calculations for prot and nonc sequences. To assure that nonc peptide sequences do not match other protein coding genes, all peptides found by Andromeda or Comet were aligned against the UniProt (www.uniprot.org) sequence database (human reviewed sequences with isoforms, downloaded 18\/12\/2018), where leucine and iso-leucines were treated as equal since they are not distinguishable by mass spectrometry. If peptides were found matching standard UniProt sequences, they were assigned as prot with the UniProt IDs. However, we assigned and kept TE peptide sequences that matched  annotated TEs that were integrated into the human reference in UniProt.  As schematically described in Supplementary Figure 1, the Comet FDR calculation was done separately for prot and nonc PSMs with an in-house software written in Java, which utilizes the MzJava class library77. All PSMs resulting from the Comet search, including the decoy PSMs (decoy hits originating from reversed sequences), were split into three sublists with PSMs of charge (Z) 1, 2, and charge 3 or higher. The three Comet scores XCorr, deltaCn and spScore were considered. It has been shown that when feature vectors are partitioned into different groups, group-wise local FDR (lFDR) calculation provides the most sensitive decision boundaries, for controlling the global FDR78. Therefore, the 3D space (XCorr, deltaCn and spScore) was partitioned into small cells (40 intervals in each dimension) and the lFDR was estimated for each cell. We used the following equation to calculate the lFDR:  (1) lFDR(x,Z)=(π_0 p(x│Z,H=0))\/(π_0 p(x│Z,H=0)+π_1 p(x│Z,H=1) )=(1+π_1\/π_0 ∙(p(x│Z,H=1))\/(p(x│Z,H=0) ))^(-1) =(1+π_1\/π_0  γ(x,Z))^(-1)         where π_0 and π_1 are the class probabilities for true (H=1) and wrong (H=0) PSMs, and  p(x│Z,H=0,1) are the probability distributions for feature vector  x=(XCorr,deltaCn,spScore) of PSMs with charge Z. The probability ratio γ(x,Z) is estimated for every cell and charge using all the target and decoy PSMs. The π_1⁄π_0  ratios are calculated for the nonc and prot groups separately and then the π_1⁄π_0  ratios are plugged into Equation (1). This way the lFDR values are calculated for every cell for both groups. For each cell, the number of wrong hits (n0) is set to the number of decoy hits in that cell, while the number of true hits (n1) is set to the number of target hits minus n0. These counts are then smoothed by replacing the values to average counts of the neighboring cells. Then γ(x,Z)=n_1⁄n_0  or γ(x,Z)=1 if n0 = 0. The target and decoy PSMs are further split into nonc and prot PSMs. Since there usually are not enough PSMs to estimate γ(x,Z) for the nonc group, γ(x,Z) is taken from all PSMs but π_1⁄π_0  is adapted for each group. Therefore, it is assumed that the score distributions are the same for each group, but that the ratio of true to wrong PSMs may change. The π_1⁄π_0  ratios are calculated for the nonc and prot groups separately and then the π_1⁄π_0  ratios are plugged into Equation (1). This way the lFDR values are calculated for every cell for both groups separately. The π_1⁄π_0  ratio in the nonc group is relatively smaller than the prot π_1⁄π_0  ratio, because the nonc database is larger and mostly consists of peptides that are not present in the sample.  This will lead to a larger nonc lFDR value, and to a more conservative filtering of nonc PSMs. Finally, the lFDR threshold is adjusted to allow a global FDR of 1% for the nonc and prot groups. PSMs from both search tools were combined and only the intersection, meaning PSMs with identical Comet and Andromeda matches (same peptide sequence with the same modification) were retained.",

    "description":"The identification and prediction of HLA-I–peptide interactions play an important role in our understanding of antigen recognition in infected or malignant cells. In cancer, non-self HLA-I ligands can arise from many different alterations, including non-synonymous mutations, gene fusion, cancer-specific alternative mRNA splicing or aberrant post-translational modifications. In this study, we collected in-depth phosphorylated HLA-I peptidomics data (1,920 unique phosphorylated peptides) from several studies covering 67 HLA-I alleles and expanded our motif deconvolution tool to identify precise binding motifs of phosphorylated HLA-I ligands for several alleles. In addition to the previously observed preferences for phosphorylation at P4, for proline next to the phosphosite and for arginine at P1, we could detect a clear enrichment of phosphorylated peptides among HLA-C ligands and among longer peptides. Binding assays were used to validate and interpret these observations. We then used these data to develop the first predictor of HLA-I– phosphorylated peptide interactions and demonstrated that combining phosphorylated and unmodified HLA-I ligands in the training of the predictor led to highest accuracy.",

    "description":"Peptides generated by proteasome-catalyzed splicing of non-contiguous amino acid sequences have been shown to constitute a source of non-templated human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) epitopes, but their role in pathogen-specific immunity remains unknown. CD8+ T cells are key mediators of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) control, and identification of novel epitopes to enhance targeting of infected cells is a priority for prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. To explore the contribution of proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS) to HIV-1 epitope generation, we developed a broadly-applicable mass spectrometry-based discovery workflow that we employed to identify spliced HLA-I-bound peptides on HIV-infected cells. We demonstrate that HIV-1-derived spliced peptides comprise a novel, but relatively minor, component of the HLA-I-bound viral immunopeptidome. Although spliced HIV-1 peptides may elicit CD8+ T cell responses relatively infrequently during infection, CD8+ T cells primed by partially-overlapping contiguous epitopes in HIV-infected individuals were able to cross-recognize spliced viral peptides, suggesting a potential role for PCPS in restricting HIV-1 escape pathways. Vaccine-mediated priming of responses to spliced HIV-1 epitopes could thus provide a novel means of exploiting epitope targets typically under-utilized during natural infection.",

    "description":"Identification of physiologically relevant peptide vaccine targets calls for the direct analysis of the entirety of naturally presented human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands, termed the HLA ligandome. In this study, we implemented this direct approach using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to define acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated peptide vaccine targets. Mapping the HLA class I ligandomes of 15 AML patients and 35 healthy controls, more than 25 000 different naturally presented HLA ligands were identified. Target prioritization based on AML exclusivity and high presentation frequency in the AML cohort identified a panel of 132 LiTAAs (ligandome-derived tumor-associated antigens), and 341 corresponding HLA ligands (LiTAPs (ligandome-derived tumor-associated peptides)) represented subset independently in >20% of AML patients. Functional characterization of LiTAPs by interferon-γ ELISPOT (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot) and intracellular cytokine staining confirmed AML-specific CD8+ T-cell recognition. Of note, our platform identified HLA ligands representing several established AML-associated antigens (e.g. NPM1, MAGED1, PRTN3, MPO, WT1), but found 80% of them to be also represented in healthy control samples. Mapping of HLA class II ligandomes provided additional CD4+ T-cell epitopes and potentially synergistic embedded HLA ligands, allowing for complementation of a multipeptide vaccine for the immunotherapy of AML.",

    "description":"Predicting the outcome of immunotherapy treatment in melanoma patients is challenging. Alterations in genes involved in antigen presentation and the interferon gamma (IFN) pathway play an important role in the immune response to tumors. We describe here that the overexpression of PSMB8 and PSMB9, two components of the immunoproteasome, is predictive of better survival and improved response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors of melanoma patients. We study the mechanism that underlies this connection by analyzing the antigenic peptide repertoire of cells that overexpress these subunits using HLA peptidomics. We find a higher response of patient-matched tumor infiltrating lymphocytes against antigens deferentially presented after immunoproteasome overexpression. which may explain the higher immune infiltration observed in patients with high immunoproteasome expression levels. Importantly, we find that PSMB8 and PSMB9 expression levels are much stronger predictors of melanoma patients immune response to checkpoint inhibitors than the tumors mutational burden.  Taken together, these results suggest that their expression levels can serve as important biomarkers for stratifying melanoma patients for immune-checkpoint treatment.",

The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4˚C and 48,000g for 60 minutes, and then passed through a pre-clearing column containing Protein-A Sepharose beads. HLA-I molecules were immunoaffinity purified from cleared lysate with the pan-HLA-I antibody (W6\/32 antibody purified from HB95 hybridoma cells) covalently bound to Protein-A Sepharose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Affinity column was washed first with 10 column volumes of 400mM NaCl, 20mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 and then with 10 volumes of 20mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0. The HLA peptides and HLA molecules were eluted with 1% TFA followed by separation of the peptides from the proteins by binding the eluted fraction to disposable reversed-phase C18 columns (Harvard Apparatus) as in.

Full scan MS spectra was acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m\/z with a target value of 3x106 ions. Ions were accumulated to an AGC target value of 105 with a maximum injection time of generally 100 msec. The peptide match option was set to Preferred.

    "description":"Tumor heterogeneity results from clonal diversity and evolutionary selection, and is a major cause of therapeutic resistance. Immunotherapy may exploit alternative vulnerabilities of drug resistant cells, and tumor-specific HLA peptide ligands on the cell surface are promising leads to invoke such targeted anti-tumor responses. In this work, we investigate the variability in HLA class I peptide presentation between tumor cells of the same patient, as differential ligand presentation could impact the efficacy of immunological interventions. By organoid amplification, we modeled single-cell level heterogeneity in a MSI- colorectal cancer patient, and directly correlated clonal tumor proteomes with the respective ligandomes. With deep comparative proteome profiling and sensitive detection of >7000 peptide ligands from each tumor organoid line, we found tumor-surface peptide presentation to be largely uncoupled from the steady-state protein abundance. Within the small minority of tumor-specific ligands (~3%), source proteins needed for DNA damage sensing and repair, and tumor suppression were prominently featured, leading us to speculate that such peptides may be consistently presented, as degradative byproducts of intended silencing. While clone-specific differences in peptide presentation were observed, inter-clone variability was also highly prevalent (15-25%). Collectively, these illustrate the heterogeneous peptide presentation landscape even within one individual, and hint that a multi-peptide vaccination approach against highly conserved tumor suppressors may be a viable option in patients with low tumor-mutational burden.",

The antibodies employed were the pan-HLA class I-specific antibody W6\/32, the HLA-DR-specific antibody L243, and the pan-HLA class II-specific antibody Tü39. All antibodies were produced in house (University of Tübingen, Department of Immunology) from HB-95, HB-55 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and a hybridoma clone. The antibodies were cross-linked to CNBr-activated sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a ratio of 40 mg sepharose to 1 mg antibody for 1 g tissue with 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.3. Free activated CNBr reaction sites were blocked with 0.2 M glycine. To purify HLA-peptide complexes, the tissue was minced with a scalpel and further homogenized with the Potter-Elvehjem instrument (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany). Tissue homogenization was performed in lysis buffer consisting of CHAPS (Panreac AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), and one cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) in PBS. Thereafter, the lysate was sonicated and cleared by centrifugation for 45 min at 4,000 rpm, interspaced by 1 h incubation periods on a shaker at 4°C. Lysates were further cleared by sterile filtration employing a 5 μm filter unit (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The first column contained 1 mg of W6\/32 antibody coupled to sepharose, whereas the second column contained equal amounts of Tü39 and L243 antibody coupled to sepharose. Finally, the lysates were passed through two columns cyclically overnight at 4°C. Affinity columns were then washed for 30 minutes with PBS and for 1 h with water. Elution of peptides was achieved by incubating four times successively with 100 – 200 μl 0.2% TFA on a shaker. All eluted fractions were subsequently pooled. Peptides were separated from the HLA molecule remnants by ultrafiltration employing 3 kDa and 10 kDa Amicon filter units (Merck Millipore) for HLA-I and HLA-II, respectively. The eluate volume was then reduced to approximately 50 μl by lyophilization or vacuum centrifugation. Finally, the reduced peptide solution was purified five times using ZipTip pipette tips with C18 resin and 0.6 μl bed volume (Merck,) and eluted in 32.5% ACN\/0.2% TFA. The purified peptide solution was concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and supplemented with 1% ACN\/0.05% TFA and stored at -80°C until LC-MS\/MS analysis.  HLA ligand characterization was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with a Nanospray FlexTM Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano UHPLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide samples were loaded with 1% ACN\/ 0.05% TFA on a 75 μm x 2 cm Acclaim™ PepMap™ C18 Nanotrap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 4 μl\/min for 10 minutes. Separation was performed on a 50 μm x 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) column, with a particle size of 2 μm. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient from 3% to 40% solvent B (80% ACN, 0.15% FA in water) over 90 minutes. The column was subsequently washed by increasing to 95% B within 1 minute, and maintaining the gradient for 5 minutes, followed by reduction to 3% B and equilibration for 23 minutes.   Data acquisition was performed as technical triplicates in data-dependent mode, with customized top speed (3 s) methods for HLA-I- and HLA-II-eluted peptides. HLA-I peptides have a length of 8 - 12 amino acids, therefore, the scan range was restricted to 400 - 650 m\/z and charge states of 2 - 3. MS1 and MS2 spectra were detected in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 and 30,000 respectively. Furthermore, we set the automatic gain control (AGC) targets to 1.5*105 and 7.0*104 and the maximum injection time to 50 ms and 150 ms for MS1 and MS2, respectively. The dynamic exclusion was set to 7 s. Peptides were fragmented with collision-induced dissociation (CID) while the collision energy was set to 35%.HLA-II peptides have a length of 8 - 25 amino acids, thus the scan range was set to 400 -1,000 m\/z and the charge states were restricted to 2 - 5. Readout for both MS1 and MS2 were performed in the Orbitrap with the same resolution and maximum injection times as for HLA-I peptides. The dynamic exclusion was set to 10 s and AGC values employed were 5.0*105 and 7.0*104 for MS1 and MS2, respectively.

    "title":"Proteogenomic analysis unveils the expression of cancer associated and specific antigen-derived HLA Class ǀ immunopeptides in melanoma and EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma",
    "description":"Immunotherapy has shown great therapeutic potential for cancers with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), but much less promise for cancers with low TMB. One primary approach for adoptive lymphocyte transfer-based immunotherapy is to target the somatic mutated peptide neoantigens and cancer testis (CT) antigens recognized by cytotoxic T cells. Here, we employed mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteogenomic large-scale profiling to identify potential immunogenic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class ǀ- associated peptides in both melanoma, a “hot tumor”, and EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma, a “cold tumor”. We uncovered 19 common driver oncogene-derived peptides and more than 1000 post-translationally modified peptides (PTM) representing 58 different PTMs. We constructed a CT antigen database with 286 antigens by compiling reputed CT antigen resources and “in-house” genomic data and used this to identify 45 CT antigen-derived peptides from the identified HLA peptidome. Using integrated next generation sequencing data, we discovered 12 neopeptides in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines. Finally, we report a novel approach for non-canonical peptide discovery, whereby we leveraged a deep learning-based de novo search and a high confidence annotated long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) database to identify 44 lncRNA-derived peptides. Findings of this study, for the first time, provide evidence for a large pool of actionable cancer antigen-derived peptides for use in mutant EGFR lung cancer immunotherapy.",

No 78430, Thermo Scientific), after washing three times with ice cold PBS. After 30min on ice, lysates were subjected to needle sonication for 30s. Approximately 30mg snap-frozen lung tumor tissue was homogenized in 4ml ico-cold lysis buffer for 30s at 4°C using the Qiagen TissueLyser II. Cell\/tissue lysates were centrifuged for 2 hours at 4°C at 20,000g, and the supernatant used in subsequent experiments. HLA-peptides complexes were isolated by interacting with 0.5mg HLA Class ǀ pan antibody clone W6\/32 (BioXcell, West Lebanon, NH) pre-coupled to 200μl slurry of protein A\/G PLUS agarose resin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4°C with constant rotation. Agarose beads were then washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer (without triton and protease inhibitors), followed by two washes in ice-cold 20mM Tris-HCl (pH=8.5), then one wash in ice-cold HPLC grade water. Complexes were eluted four times with 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water at room temperature and combined. To purify immunopeptides, HLA-peptide complexes were loaded on preconditioned 50mg C18 desalting columns (Sigma Millipore), then followed three 0.1% TFA in water washes. HLA peptides were then eluted with 40% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA. Purified peptides were lyophilized at -80°C for 2hours, then, reconstituted in 0.1%TFA, 2%ACN loading buffer for MS analysis.",
    "data_protocol":"Patient and cell line specific protein sequence databases were first generated. The aligned whole exome sequencing BAM files from patient blood (germline) or tumor tissue\/cell lines were used to retrieve the variants call format (VCF) using HaplotypeCaller [63], and the intermediate VCF files were further annotated by SnpEff [64]which filtered out only nonsynonymous on exome regions including SNVs and Indels. Similarly, the RNA-sequencing BAM files were used for the fusion variant calling by Star-Fusion [65]. The final VCF files were in silico translated to sample specific protein sequence libraries (FASTA files) using QUILTS [66], which were merged with refseq hg38 converted human proteome database.  The database search of MS raw files was carried out by PEKAS studio [39] (Bioinformatics Solutions) using the patient\/cell line specific databases described above. In the PEAKS searching engine, no enzyme digestion was selected because HLA peptides are natural peptides without artificial digestion. Importantly, the unique PEAKS built-in functions, pan-PTMs including 650 different variable modifications and de novo searching were used. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 15ppm and fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.5Da. For the mutant neoepitope screening, the false discovery rate (FDR), estimated by decoy-fusion database, was chosen at 0.05. For the wt peptides screening (e.g., CT antigen, LncRNA and PTMs), FDR was set to 0.01. For the de novo search, we applied very stringent criteria, a) the average local confidence (ALC) score (substituted for FDR estimation) of each peptides must be >50%; b) the lowest %rank, predicted by NetMHCpan4.0, of each peptides against their corresponding HLA molecules in the same sample must be <2.0. The detected raw peptide intensity was log2 transformed for further statistical analysis.",

    "title":"Biogenesis of HLA ligand presentation in immune cells upon activation reveals changes in peptide length preference",
    "description":"Induction of an effective tumor immunity is a complex process that includes the appropriate presentation of the tumor antigens, activation of specific T cells, and the elimination of malignant cells. Potent and efficient T cell activation is dependent on multiple factors, such as timely expression of co-stimulatory molecules, the differentiation state of professional antigen presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells; DCs), the functionality of the antigen processing and presentation machinery (APPM), and the repertoire of HLA class I and II-bound peptides (termed immunopeptidome) presented to T cells. So far, how molecular perturbations underlying DCs maturation and differentiation affect the in vivo cross-presented HLA class I and II immunopeptidomes is largely unknown. Yet, this knowledge is crucial for further development of DC-based immunotherapy approaches. We applied a state-of-the-art sensitive MS-based immunopeptidomics approach to characterize the naturally presented HLA-I and -II immunopeptidomes eluted from autologous immune cells having distinct functional and biological states including CD14+ monocytes, immature DC (ImmDC) and mature DC (MaDC) monocyte-derived DCs and naive or activated T and B cells. We revealed a presentation of significantly longer HLA peptides upon activation that is HLA allotype specific. This was apparent in the self-peptidome upon cell activation and in the context of presentation of exogenously loaded antigens. Importantly, a similar trend was also present in a large collection of immunogenic HLA-I epitopes from pathogens, suggesting that peptide length is an important feature with potential implications on the rational design of anti-cancer vaccines.",

    "sample_protocol":"For high-throughput HLA-I and -II immunoaffinity purification, we used a previously described protocol from our group.  We used the 96-well single-use micro-plate with glass fiber and 10 µm polypropylene membranes. Cell lysis was performed with PBS containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Mixture, 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1% octyl-beta-D glucopyranoside at 4 °C for 1 h. Lysis buffer was added to the cells at a concentration of 1 ml per 5e6 cells. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation with a table-top centrifuge at 4 °C at 14,200 rpm for 30 min. Anti-pan HLA-I (HB95) and HLA-II (HB145) antibodies cross-linked to protein-A sepharose 4B beads beads were loaded on their respective plates at a final bead volume of 100 ul. The lysates were loaded by gravity first through the HLA-I affinity plate and then through the HLA-II affinity plate at 4 °C. The plates were washed separately using the Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor four times with 2 ml of 150 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, four times with 2 ml of 400 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and again four times with 2 ml of 150 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Finally, the beads were washed twice with 2 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Two Sep-Pak tC18 100 mg Sorbent 96-well plates were required for the purification and concentration of HLA-I and HLA-II peptides. Each C18 plate was handled separately. Each affinity plate was stacked on top of a C18 plate and the HLA complexes including the peptides were eluted with 500 µl of 1% TFA. The C18 wells were washed with 2 ml of 0.1% TFA. Thereafter, the HLA peptides were eluted with 500 µl of 32% acetonitrile (ACN)) in 0.1% TFA. The recovered HLA-I and -II peptide samples were transferred separately into eppendorf tubes, dried using vacuum centrifugation and stored at -20 °C.  Cell pellets of approximately 1e6 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer composed of 8 M Urea and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8. The cell lysates were sonicated in the Bioruptor instrument for 15 cycles, each cycle at maximum mA for 30 s at 4 °C. Subsequently, centrifugation at 20,000 g at 4 °C for 30 min separated the soluble from the insoluble protein fractions. The soluble fraction was collected and the protein concentration of the lysates was determined by a Bradford protein assay. Proteins were reduced with a final concentration of 5 mM DTT at 37 °C for 60 min, followed by alkylation with a final concentration of 15 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 60 min in the dark. After the alkylation step, the digestion was carried out with a mixture of endoproteinase Lys-C and Trypsin. The first step consists of endoproteinase Lys-C digestion for 4 h at 37 °C with a protein to enzyme ratio of 50:1 (w\/w). Subsequently, the samples were diluted 8 times with 50 mM AMBIC to a Urea concentration of 1 M. The second step of digestion was performed with Trypsin overnight at 37 °C with a substrate to enzyme ratio of 50:1 (w\/w). After digestion, the samples were acidified with formic acid (FA) and desalted on C18 spin columns.  HLA-I and HLA-II peptide samples were re-suspended in 9 ul of 0.1% FA and 2\/3 of the sample volume were placed in the UHPLC autosampler. All samples were acquired using the nanoflow UHPLC Easy nLC 1200 coupled online to a Q Exactive HF or a HFX Orbitrap mass spectrometers with a nanoelectrospray ion source. We packed the uncoated PicoTip 8 µm tip opening with 75 µm i.d. 45 cm long analytical columns with ReproSil-Pur C18. Mounted analytical columns were kept at 50 °C using a column oven.  For proteomics, data-dependent “top15” method was used. The mass spectrometer scan range was set to 300 to 1650 m\/z with a resolution of 60,000 (200 m\/z) and the mass spectrometer scan range was set to 300 to 800 m\/z. For MS\/MS, AGC target values of 1e5 were used with a maximum injection time 25 ms at set resolution of 15,000 (200 m\/z). The peptide match option was disabled. In case of unassigned precursor ion charge states or a charge state of one, no fragmentation was performed and the peptide match option was set to “preferred.” The dynamic exclusion of precursor ions from further selection was set for 20 s.  For immunopeptidomics, data was acquired with data-dependent “top10” method, which isolates within a 1.2 m\/z window the ten most abundant precursor ions and fragments them by higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at normalized collision energy of 27%. The mass spectrometer scan range was set to 300 to 1650 m\/z with a resolution of 60,000 (200 m\/z) and the AGC target value of 3e6 ions was set. For MS\/MS, AGC target values of 1e5 were used with a maximum injection time of 175 ms. For HLA-I peptidomics, in case of assigned precursor ion charge states of four and above, no fragmentation was performed. For HLA-II peptidomics, in case of assigned precursor ion charge states of one, and from six and above, no fragmentation was performed.",

The second peptide identification option in Andromeda was enabled. A peptide spectrum match (PSM) false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 and no protein FDR were set for peptidomics analyses, whereas for proteomic analyses also a protein FDR of 0.01 was set.

The enzyme specificity was set as unspecific for immunopeptidomics, whereas C-terminal specificity for K and R, and maximum 3 miscleavages were chosen for analysis of proteomics samples. Possible sequence matches were restricted to 8 to 25 amino acids (a.a.) for immunopeptidomics and proteomics while to 8 to 30 a.a. for the experiments with DCs loaded with synthetic peptides. A maximum peptides mass of 4600 Da for proteomics and 3000 Da for immunopeptidomics. The initial allowed mass deviation of the precursor ion was set to 6 ppm and the maximum fragment mass deviation was set to 20 ppm. We enabled the “match between runs” option, which allows matching of identifications across different replicates in a time window of 0.5 min and an initial alignment time window of 20 min between datasets of the same donor (class I and class II separately). For proteomic analysis, “match between runs” module was enabled between all samples of the same donor and label-free quantification (LFQ) was enabled in the MaxQuant environment (32).",

    "sample_protocol":"HLA class I and class II molecules were isolated from snap-frozen tissue using standard immunoaffinity chromatography. The antibodies employed were the pan-HLA class I-specific antibody W6\/32, the HLA-DR-specific antibody L243, and the pan-HLA class II-specific antibody Tü39. All antibodies were produced in house (University of Tübingen, Department of Immunology) from HB-95, HB-55 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and a hybridoma clone. The antibodies were cross-linked to CNBr-activated sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a ratio of 40 mg sepharose to 1 mg antibody for 1 g tissue with 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.3. Free activated CNBr reaction sites were blocked with 0.2 M glycine. To purify HLA-peptide complexes, the tissue was minced with a scalpel and further homogenized with the Potter-Elvehjem instrument (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany). Tissue homogenization was performed in lysis buffer consisting of CHAPS (Panreac AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), and one cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) in PBS. Thereafter, the lysate was sonicated and cleared by centrifugation for 45 min at 4,000 rpm, interspaced by 1 h incubation periods on a shaker at 4°C. Lysates were further cleared by sterile filtration employing a 5 μm filter unit (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The first column contained 1 mg of W6\/32 antibody coupled to sepharose, whereas the second column contained equal amounts of Tü39 and L243 antibody coupled to sepharose. Finally, the lysates were passed through two columns cyclically overnight at 4°C. Affinity columns were then washed for 30 minutes with PBS and for 1 h with water. Elution of peptides was achieved by incubating four times successively with 100 – 200 μl 0.2% TFA on a shaker. All eluted fractions were subsequently pooled. Peptides were separated from the HLA molecule remnants by ultrafiltration employing 3 kDa and 10 kDa Amicon filter units (Merck Millipore) for HLA-I and HLA-II, respectively. The eluate volume was then reduced to approximately 50 μl by lyophilization or vacuum centrifugation. Finally, the reduced peptide solution was purified five times using ZipTip pipette tips with C18 resin and 0.6 μl bed volume (Merck,) and eluted in 32.5% ACN\/0.2% TFA. The purified peptide solution was concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and supplemented with 1% ACN\/0.05% TFA and stored at -80°C until LC-MS\/MS analysis. HLA ligand characterization was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with a Nanospray FlexTM Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano UHPLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide samples were loaded with 1% ACN\/ 0.05% TFA on a 75 μm x 2 cm Acclaim™ PepMap™ C18 Nanotrap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 4 μl\/min for 10 minutes. Separation was performed on a 50 μm x 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) column, with a particle size of 2 μm. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient from 3% to 40% solvent B (80% ACN, 0.15% FA in water) over 90 minutes. The column was subsequently washed by increasing to 95% B within 1 minute, and maintaining the gradient for 5 minutes, followed by reduction to 3% B and equilibration for 23 minutes. Data acquisition was performed as technical triplicates in data-dependent mode, with customized top speed (3 s) methods for HLA-I- and HLA-II-eluted peptides. HLA-I peptides have a length of 8 - 12 amino acids, therefore, the scan range was restricted to 400 - 650 m\/z and charge states of 2 - 3. MS1 and MS2 spectra were detected in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 and 30,000 respectively. Furthermore, we set the automatic gain control (AGC) targets to 1.5*105 and 7.0*104 and the maximum injection time to 50 ms and 150 ms for MS1 and MS2, respectively. The dynamic exclusion was set to 7 s. Peptides were fragmented with collision-induced dissociation (CID) while the collision energy was set to 35%.HLA-II peptides have a length of 8 - 25 amino acids, thus the scan range was set to 400 -1,000 m\/z and the charge states were restricted to 2 - 5. Readout for both MS1 and MS2 were performed in the Orbitrap with the same resolution and maximum injection times as for HLA-I peptides. The dynamic exclusion was set to 10 s and AGC values employed were 5.0*105 and 7.0*104 for MS1 and MS2, respectively.

    "title":"An integrated genomic, proteomic and immunopeptidomic approach to discover treatment-induced neoantigens",
    "description":"All nucleated mammalian cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins that present peptides on cell surfaces for immune surveillance. These MHC-presented peptides (pMHC) can convey non-self antigens derived from pathogens or mutations to amount T-cell responses. Alterations in tumor-specific antigens – particularly mutation-bearing peptides (neoantigens) presented by MHC — can serve as potent substrates for anti-tumor immune responses. Here we employed an integrated genomic and proteomic antigen discovery strategy aimed at measuring interferon gamma (IFN-γ) induced alterations to antigen presentation, using a lymphoma cell line. IFN-γ treatment resulted in a set of differentially expressed proteins (2 % of all quantified proteins) including components of antigen presentation machinery or interferon signaling pathways. In addition, several proteasome subunits were found to be modulated, consistent with previous reports of immunoproteasome induction by IFN-γ exposure. This finding suggests that a modest proteomic response to IFN-γ could create larger alteration to cells antigen repertoires. Accordingly, by surveying immunopeptides, distinct peptide repertoires were exclusively observed in the IFN-γ induced samples. Furthermore, an additional set of presented peptides distinguished control and the IFN-γ samples by their altered relative abundances including neoantigens. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to distinguish peptides which are differentially presented due to altered expression from novel peptides resulting from changes in antigen processing. Taken together, these data demonstrate that IFN-γ can re-shape antigen repertoires by identity and by abundance. Extending this approach to models with greater clinical relevance should help develop strategies by which immunopeptide repertoires are intentionally reshaped to improve endogenous or vaccine-induced anti-tumor immune responses and potentially anti-viral immune responses.",

In brief, cells were lysed and the lysate was subjected to centrifugation and then precleared using rProtein A Sepharose fast-flow beads (GE Healthcare). For all MHC-1 captures the precleared lysate was incubated with the pan HLA-A-, B-, and C- antibody W6\/32 coupled to rProtein A Sepharose fast-flow beads. For MHC class II captures the precleared lysate was incubated with the HLA-DR specific antibody L243 coupled to rProtein A Sepharose fast-flow beads. Following the immune-capture, the beads were washed with TBS and peptides were eluted from the purified MHC-molecules using 10% acetic acid. The peptides were further purified with a MWCO size filter, followed by a concentration step and then desalted. The isolated peptides were analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific).   For standard proteome analysis the cells were lysed in 8M urea, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris pH 8 supplemented with protease inhibitors. Samples were alkylated with iodoacetamide and then quenched with DTT. Proteins were further isolated by methanol-chloroform precipitation, and the protein pellet was washed with acetone before being re-suspended in 8M urea, 50 mM Tris pH 8.

Samples were acidified with 25% formic acid to pH 2, desalted and resuspended in 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. Peptides were then fractionated by high-pH reverse phase fractionation. In total 84 fractions were collected, concatenated and combined into a total of 12 fractions and then desalted, dried down and stored at -80°C until final LC-MS\/MS measurement. The peptides were analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific).",
    "data_protocol":"For immunopeptidome data all tandem mass spectra were queried against the GRANTA-519 proteome databases using both SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994) and PEAKS DB search engines (PEAKS Studio 8) (Zhang et al., 2012). Spectra were also interpreted by de novo sequencing (PEAKS Studio 8) to improve high-confidence peptide identification. For all searches with SEQUEST the msConvert program (v3.0.45) was used to generate peak lists from the original data, and spectra were then assigned to peptides using the SEQUEST (v28.12) algorithm. For all searches with PEAKS the RAW data files were imported into PEAKS and subjected to default data refinement (deisotoping, charge deconvolution, peak centroiding). For all searches, the parent mass error tolerance was set to 20 ppm and the fragment mass error tolerance to 0.02 Da. For SEQUEST and PEAKS DB, enzyme specificity was set to none and oxidation of methionines and deamidation (N,Q), cysteinylation, and phosphorylation (S, T, Y) was searched as a variable modification. High-confidence peptide identifications were selected at a 1% false discovery rate with the Percolator algorithm (Käll et al., 2007).   For the proteome profiling experiment the raw data analysis was performed using ProteomeDiscover v2.1.0.81 (Thermo Fischer Scientific) using SEQUEST-HT and the parent mass error tolerance was set to 20 ppm and the fragment mass error tolerance to 0.6 Da. Strict trypsin specificity was required allowing up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification and oxidation of methionines as a variable modification. The minimum required peptide length was set to seven amino acids. A false discovery rate of 0.01 was required at both the peptide level and protein level for the proteome data with the Percolator algorithm (Käll et al., 2007).",

    "sample_protocol":"HLA class I-complexes and separation of HLA class I-peptides were purified according to the high-throughput protocol developed by Chong and colleagues (PMID: 30666599) omitting the pre-clear and HLA class II plate. For LC-MS\/MS analysis pooled samples were resuspended in 30 µl of 0.1% formic acid (Fisher Scientific) and 4.5 µl were used per injection. Lyophilized synthetic peptides for validation of frameshift peptides were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies (Berlin, Germany) and diluted to a concentration of 100 fmol\/ul and 3 µl were used per injection. The mass spectrometric analysis was conducted using an UltiMate™ 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) directly coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded onto the trapping cartridge (µ-Precolumn C18 PepMap 100, 5µm, 300 µm i.d. x 5 mm, 100 Å) for 3 min at 30 µL\/min (0.05% TFA in water). Peptides were eluted and separated on an analytical column (nanoEase MZ HSS T3 column, 100 Å, 1.8 μm, 75 μm x 250 mm) with a constant flow of 0.3 µL\/min using solvent A (0.1% formic acid in LC-MS grade water, Fisher Scientific) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in LC-MS grade acetonitrile, Fisher Chemicals). Total analysis time for the HCD method was 90 min with a gradient containing an 8-25% solvent B elution step for 69 min, followed by an increase to 40% solvent B for 5 min, 85% B for 4 min and re-equilibration step to initial conditions. The LC system was coupled online to the mass spectrometer using a Nanospray-Flex ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a Pico-Tip Emitter 360 µm OD x 20 µm ID; 10 µm tip (New Objective). The MS was operated in positive mode and a spray voltage of 2.4 kV was applied for ionization with an ion transfer tube temperature of 275 °C. Full scan MS spectra were acquired in profile mode for a mass range of 300-1650 m\/z at a resolution of 120 000 (RF Lens 30%, AGC target 4e5 ions, and maximum injection time of 250 ms). The instrument was operated in data-dependent mode for MS\/MS acquisition. Peptide fragment spectra were acquired for charge states 1-4. The quadrupole isolation window was set to 1.2 m\/z and peptides were fragmented via HCD (30%). Fragment mass spectra were recorded at a resolution of 30 000 for a maximum of 2e5 ions (AGC target) or after 150 ms maximum injection time. The instrument acquired MS\/MS spectra for up to 3 s between MS scans. Dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s. Additionally, samples were analyzed using two HCD\/EThcD decision tree methods. Here, the instrument fragmented precursors with a charge state of +1 using the parameters of the HCD method. Charge states 2-7 were fragmented using ETD (Calibrated Charge-Dependent ETD Parameters) with supplemental activation enabled (HCD, 30%). For MS\/MS spectra acquisition, either high abundant (EThcD) or low abundant (lowEThcD) precursors were selected first. AGC target was set to 2e5 ions and a maximum injection time of 200 ms was allowed and the resulting MS\/MS spectra were recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 30 000. Total analysis time for the HCD\/EThcD decision tree methods was 180 min with a gradient containing an 8-25% solvent B elution step for 150 min, followed by an increase to 40% solvent B for 14 min, 85% B for 4 min and re-equilibration step to initial conditions. To further validate the presence of the candidates and to obtain reliable quantification data, InDel neoepitope candidates were measured from the same samples using a targeted MS2 method with the previously described settings.",
    "data_protocol":"Mass spectrometry raw data were analyzed using PEAKS Studio X (version 10.0, Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.), which combines peptide de novo sequencing and traditional database search approaches. Raw files were subjected to the default data refinement before de novo sequencing and database search. The parent mass error tolerance was set to 10.0 ppm while the fragment mass error tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. Fragmentation mode was set either to “HCD” or “Mixed” (for EThcD measurements with HCD fragmentation for single positive precursors). All raw files were first searched against the UniProt\/SwissProt database (20659 entries, February 2019) and database containing standard contaminants with oxidation of methionine (15.99 Da), carbamidomethylation of cysteine (57.02 Da), and acetylation of N-termini (42.01) as variable modifications. The enzyme specificity was set to “no enzyme”. De novo only spectra with an average local confidence of more than 50% (i.e. good spectra not matching a UniProt\/SwissProt database entry), were subjected to a multi-round database search using the in-house generated frameshift peptide databases based on CCLE (747 entries), COSMIC (1071 entries) and the SNP neoepitope datasets (1526 entries). All peptides identified at a peptide spectrum match (PSM) FDR of 1% were exported and contaminants, as well as peptides shorter than 8 AAs and longer than 15 AAs, were filtered out. Unique peptides matching to entries of the UniProt\/SwissProt database were reported as “endogenous”, while peptides matching one of the FSP databases were reported as “InDel neoepitopes” and peptides matching the SNP neoepitope database were reported as “SNP neoepitopes”. Binding prediction to the expressed HLA allotypes was performed using NetMHCpan (version 4.0a)(PMID: 28978689). The rank threshold for binders was set to <0.5% for strong binders (SB) and <2% for weak binders (WB). For peptides binding to more than one HLA allotype, only the best ranked HLA allotype with its corresponding affinity in nM was reported. Peptide sequences were clustered using GibbsCluster (version 2.0)(PMID: 28407089) with default parameters for MHC class I ligands and motifs were visualized with Seq2Logo (version 2.0)(PMID: 22638583). Hydrophobicity indices of identified peptides were calculated using SSRcalc version Q (PMID: 17105172) using the following parameters: 100Å C18 column, 0.1% Formic Acid (2015 model), no cysteine protection. Spectra recorded from synthetic peptides were compared to spectra measured from the samples. Briefly, all spectra recorded for a given peptide were compared to all spectra recorded from its synthetic counterpart. Raw data for matched fragment ions was exported from PEAKS Studio X (PSM-ions.txt), normalized intensities of matched fragment ions were correlated and the match with the highest correlation was reported graphically. Moreover, retention time differences between the two peptides were calculated and reported. Quantification of HLA-presented peptides was performed using the raw output (peptides.csv) from PEAKS and a custom script in the R programming language (ISBN 3-900051-07-0). First, measured intensities from InDel neoepitope candidates using parallel reaction monitoring were combined with measured intensities from endogenous peptides and data were filtered to include only peptides which were measured in at least two out of three replicates per condition and MS method used. Subsequent steps were performed for each MS method separately. Potential batch effects between biological replicates were removed using the limma package (PMID: 25605792). Next, the variance stabilization normalization method was performed on the log2 transformed raw data using the vsn package (PMID: 12169536) with individual normalization coefficients for the different MS methods. Missing values were imputed with the Msnbase package using nearest neighbor averaging (PMID: 22113085). Normalized data were tested for differential HLA presentation of peptides between DMSO and 5AZA treated samples using the limma package. The replicate factor was included in the linear model. Peptides with a FDR ≤ 0.05 and an FC > 2 were defined as hits while peptides with an FDR ≤ 0.2 and an FC ≥ 1.5 were defined as candidates. Results were visualized using the ggplot2 package (ISBN 978-3-319-24277-4).",

    "description":"Various bacterial species are known to colonize human tumors , proliferate within them and modulate immune function, ultimately affecting patient survival and response to treatment. However, it is not known whether intracellular bacterial antigens are presented by HLA-I and HLA-II molecules of tumor cells, and whether potential tumor-presented bacterial-derived antigens may elicit a tumor infiltrating T-cell immune response. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and HLA-peptidomics to unbiasedly identify an intracellular bacterial peptide repertoire presented on HLA-I and HLA-II molecules in melanoma tumors. Our microbial analysis of 17 melanoma metastases, derived from 9 patients, revealed 248 and 38 unique HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, respectively, derived from 41 different classified bacterial species. Recurrent bacterial peptides were identified in different tumors. Our study reveals that intra-tumor intracellular bacteria can be presented by tumor cells and elicit immune-reactivity, thus providing insight into how bacteria influence immune system activation and response to therapy.",

    "sample_protocol":"Production and purification of membrane HLA molecules Tumor sample weights ranged from 0.1-0.8 grams. Cell-line pellets were collected from 2x108 cells. Tumor samples and cell pellets were homogenized through a cell strainer on ice with a lysis buffer containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340), 1 mM PMSF and 1% octyl-b-D glucopyranoside in PBS. Samples were then incubated in rotation at 4˚C for 1 hour. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 48,000 g for 60 minutes at 4˚C and then passed through a pre-clearing column containing Protein-A Sepharose beads.  HLA-I molecules were immunoaffinity purified from cleared lysate with the pan-HLA-I antibody (W6\/32 antibody purified from HB95 hybridoma cells) covalently bound to Protein-A Sepharose beads. HLA-II molecules were then purified by transferring the flow-through to similar affinity columns containing a pan-HLA-II antibody (purified from HB-145 hybridoma cells). Affinity columns were washed first with 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl and then with 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0. The HLA-peptide complexes were then eluted with 1% trifluoracetic acid followed by separation of the peptides from the proteins by binding the eluted fraction to Sep-Pak (Waters). Elution of the peptides was done with 28% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid for HLA-I and 32% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid for HLA-II.   Mass-spectrometry analysis of eluted HLA peptides ULC\/MS grade solvents were used for all chromatographic steps. Each sample was solubilized in 12 µL 97:3 water: acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Samples were loaded using split-less nano-Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (10 kpsi nanoAcquity; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase was: A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid and B) acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. Desalting of the samples was performed online using a reversed-phase Symmetry C18 trapping column (180 µm internal diameter, 20 mm length, 5 µm particle size, Waters). The peptides were then separated using a T3 HSS nano-column (75 µm internal diameter, 250 mm length, 1.8 µm particle size; Waters) at 0.35 µL\/minute. Peptides were eluted from the column into the mass spectrometer using the following gradient: 5% to 28%B in 120 minutes, 28% to 35%B in 15 minutes, 35% to 95% in 15 minutes, maintained at 95% for 10 minutes and then back to initial conditions. The nanoUPLC was coupled online through a nanoESI emitter (10 μm tip; New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) to a quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific) using a FlexIon nanospray apparatus (Proxeon).  For the discovery experiments, data was acquired in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, using a Top20 method. MS1 resolution was set to 70,000 (at 400m\/z), mass range of 300-1800m\/z, automatic gain control (AGC) of 3e6 and maximum injection time was set to 100 msec. MS2 resolution was set to 17,500, quadrupole isolation 1.8m\/z, AGC of 1e5, dynamic exclusion of 20 seconds and maximum injection time of 150 msec.

    "description":"Immune checkpoint inhibitor and adoptive lymphocyte transfer-based therapies have shown great therapeutic potential for cancers with high tumor mutation burden (TMB). Here, we employed mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteogenomic large-scale profiling to identify potential immunogenic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class ǀ-presented peptides in both melanoma, a “hot tumor” with high TMB, and EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma, a “cold tumor” with low TMB. We used cell line and patient-specific databases constructed using variants identified from whole-exome sequencing, as well as a de novo search algorithm from the PEAKS search algorithm to interrogate the mass spectrometry data of the Class I immunopeptidome. We identified 12 mutant neoantigens. Several classes of tumor-associated antigen-derived peptides were also identified. We constructed a cancer germline (CG) antigen database with 285 antigens and identified 42 Class I-presented CG antigens. We identified more than 1000 post-translationally modified (PTM) peptides representing 58 different PTMs. Our results suggest that PTMs play a critical role impacting HLA-binding affinity dramatically.  Finally, leveraging de novo search and an annotated lncRNA database, we developed a novel non-canonical peptide discovery pipeline to identify 44 lncRNA-derived peptides that are presented by Class I. We validated MS\/MS spectra of select peptides using synthetic peptides and performed HLA Class I binding assays to demonstrate binding of select neo-peptides and lncRNA-derived peptides to Class I proteins. In summary, we provide direct evidence of HLA Class I presentation of a large number of mutant and tumor-associated peptides for potential use as vaccine or adoptive cell therapy in melanoma and EGFR mutant lung cancer.",

No 78430, Thermo Scientific). After 30min on ice, lysates were subjected to needle sonication for 30s. Approximately 30mg snap-frozen lung tumor tissue was homogenized in 4ml ice-cold lysis buffer for 30s at 4°C using the Qiagen TissueLyser II. Cell\/tissue lysates were centrifuged for 2 hours at 4°C at 20,000g, and the supernatant used in subsequent experiments. HLA-peptides complexes were isolated by interacting with 0.5mg HLA Class ǀ pan antibody clone W6\/32 (BioXcell, West Lebanon, NH) pre-coupled to 200μl slurry of protein A\/G PLUS agarose resin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4°C with constant rotation. Agarose beads were then washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer (without triton and protease inhibitors), followed by two washes in ice-cold 20mM Tris-HCl (pH=8.5), then one wash in ice-cold HPLC grade water.

    "data_protocol":"Patient and cell line specific protein sequence databases were first generated. The aligned whole exome sequencing BAM files from patient blood (germline) or tumor tissue\/cell lines were used to retrieve the variants call format (VCF) files using HaplotypeCaller (Ren et al., 2019), and the intermediate VCF files were further annotated by SnpEff (Cingolani et al., 2012)which filtered out only nonsynonymous on exome regions including SNVs and Indels. Similarly, BBduk was used to remove adapter sequences and low-quality reads from paired-end FASTQ files, which were then used as input for STAR-Fusion (Haas et al., 2019). The final VCF files were in silico translated to sample specific protein sequence libraries (FASTA files) using QUILTS (Ruggles et al., 2016), which were merged with refseq hg38 converted human proteome database.  The database search of MS raw files was carried out by PEAKS studio (Tran et al., 2019) (Bioinformatics Solutions) using the patient\/cell line specific databases described above. In the PEAKS searching engine, no enzyme digestion was selected because HLA peptides are natural peptides without artificial digestion. Importantly, the unique PEAKS built-in functions, pan-PTMs including 650 different variable modifications and de novo searching were used. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 15 ppm and fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. For the mutant neoepitope screening, the false discovery rate (FDR), estimated by decoy-fusion database, was chosen at 0.05. For the wt peptides screening (e.g., CG antigen, LncRNA and PTMs), FDR was set to 0.01. For the de novo search, we applied very stringent criteria, a) the average local confidence (ALC) score (substituted for FDR estimation) of each peptides must be >50%; b) the lowest %rank, predicted by NetMHCpan4.0, of each peptides against their corresponding HLA  molecules in the same sample must be <2.0.

    "title":"Improved sensitivity of immunopeptidomics by leveraging available large-scale pan-HLA spectral libraries and data-independent acquisition",
    "description":"Mass spectrometry is the state-of-the-art methodology for capturing the breadth and depth of the immunopeptidome across HLA allotypes and cell types. The majority of studies in the immunopeptidomics field are discovery-driven and data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry acquisition is commonly used, as it generates high quality references of peptide fingerprints. However, DDA suffers from the stochastic selection of abundant ions that leads to lower sensitivity and reproducibility. In contrast, in data-independent acquisition, the fragmentation and acquisition of all fragment ions from a predefined list of precursor isolation windows yields a comprehensive map for a given sample. Because often the amount of HLA peptides eluted from biological samples, is typically not sufficient for acquiring both meaningful DDA data necessary for generating comprehensive spectral libraries and DIA MS measurements, the implementation of DIA in the immunopeptidomics translational research domain has remained limited. We implemented a DIA immunopeptidomics workflow and assessed its sensitivity and accuracy by matching DIA data against libraries with growing complexity - from sample-specific libraries to libraries combining from two to forty different immunopeptidomics samples. Matching DIA immunopeptidomics data against complex pan-HLA spectral library resulted in a two-fold increase in peptide identification compared with sample-specific library and in a three-fold increase compared with DDA measurements, yet with no detrimental effect on the specificity. We concluded that a comprehensive pan-HLA library for DIA approach is highly advantageous for the clinical Immunopeptidomics where low amount of biological sample is available for immunopeptidomics.",

    "sample_protocol":"Purification of HLA binding peptides We performed HLA immunoaffinity purification according to our previously established protocols (25, 42). W6\/32 monoclonal antibodies were purified from the supernatants of HB95 (ATCC® HB-95™) using protein-A sepharose 4B (Pro-A) beads (Invitrogen), and antibodies were then cross-linked to Pro-A beads. Cells were lysed with PBS containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma Aldrich), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mM EDTA, a 1:200 protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Roche), and 1% octyl-beta-D glucopyranoside (Sigma Alrich) at 4°C for 1 hour. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation in a table-top centrifuge (Eppendorf) at 4°C for 50 min at 21,191 x g. We employed the Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor (Waters) and 96-well single-use micro-plates with 3 µm glass fibers and 10 µm polypropylene membranes (Seahorse Bioscience, ref no: 360063). The lysates were passed through a plate containing pan HLA-I antibody-crosslinked beads at 4°C. The beads in the plates were then washed with varying concentrations of salts using the processor. Finally, the beads were washed twice with 2 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Sep-Pak tC18 100 mg Sorbent 96-well plates (Waters, ref no: 186002321) were used for the purification and concentration of HLA-I peptides. The C18 sorbents were conditioned, and the HLA complexes and bound peptides were directly eluted from the affinity plate with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Sigma-Aldrich). After washing the C18 sorbents with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA, HLA-I peptides were eluted with 28% acetonitrile (ACN; Sigma Aldrich) in 0.1% TFA. Recovered HLA-I peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator plus, Eppendorf) and stored at -20°C.  LC-MS\/MS DDA and DIA analyses The LC-MS\/MS system consisted of an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) hyphenated to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 450 mm analytical column (8 µm tip, 75 µm inner diameter, PicoTipTMEmitter, New Objective) packed with ReproSil-Pur C18 (1.9 µm particles, 120 Å pore size, Dr. Maisch GmbH). The separation was performed at a flow rate of 250 nL\/min by a gradient of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in 80% ACN (solvent B) in 0.1% FA in water (solvent A). HLA-I peptides were analyzed by the following gradient: 0–5 min (5% B); 5-85 min (5-35% B); 85-100 min (35-60 % B); 100-105 min (60-95% B); 105-110 min (95% B); 110-115 min (95-2% B) and 115-125 min (2% B).  Two different parameters were used to acquire DDA data respectively for sample-specific (recent data) and the combined, mixed and BigLib libraries that composed of old data. For DDA measurements, full MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap from m\/z = 300-1650 with a resolution of 60,000 (m\/z = 200) and an ion accumulation time of 80 ms. The auto gain control (AGC) was set to 3e6 ions. MS\/MS spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner on the 10 most abundant precursor ions (and 20 for sample-specific) with a resolution of 15,000 (m\/z = 200) and 30,000 for sample-specific, an ion accumulation time of 120 ms and an isolation window of 1.2 m\/z. The AGC was set to 2e5 ions, the dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s, and a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27 was used for fragmentation. No fragmentation was performed for HLA-I peptides with assigned precursor ion charge states of four and above and the peptide match option was disabled. For DIA measurements, the cycle of acquisitions consists of a full MS scan from 300-1650 m\/z (R = 60,000 and ion accumulation time of 60 ms) and 22 DIA MS\/MS scans in the orbitrap (Supplementary Table 3). For each DIA MS\/MS scan, a resolution of 30,000, an AGC of 3e6 and a ramping normalized collision energy (NCE = 25.5, 27 and 30) were used. The maximum ion accumulation was set to auto and the overlap between consecutive MS\/MS scans was 1 m\/z.",
    "data_protocol":"DDA and DIA data analyses We employed the MaxQuant computational platform version 1.6.10.43 (43) to search the peak lists against the UniProt databases (Human 42,148 entries, March 2017) and a file containing 246 frequently observed contaminants. The default settings were used except the following parameters: enzyme specificity was set to ‘unspecific’, methionine oxidation and Protein N-term acetylation were set as a variable modifications and no fixed modification was set, PSM FDR was set to 0.01 with no protein FDR. The initial allowed mass deviation of the precursor ion was set to 6 ppm and the maximum fragment mass deviation was set to 20 ppm.  The spectral library for each sample was generated using results from MaxQuant discovery search for each experiment (sample-specific, combined, mixed and BigLib) by uploading mqpar.xml, msms.txt, evidence.txt and fastA files into Spectronaut (14.6.2) software from Biognosys, Schlieren, Switzerland. The default settings were used except the following parameters. For the mass tolerance, the calibration search was set to ‘dynamic’ and a correction factor of 1 was used for MS1 and MS2.  For identification, a FDR threshold of 0.01 and unspecific digestion rule were used in agreement with MaxQuant search.  For spectral library filtering, only peptide with a length larger than 3 a.a with at least 3 best fragments (up to 6) were considered. A deep learning assisted iRT regression and a R-square of 0.8 were respectively used for iRT reference strategy and correlation score. The selection of fragment ions based on intensity was used. For identification, the library was matched against JY, 0D5P and RA957 DIA MS\/MS data with q-value cut-off of 0.1 and 1 respectively for precursor and protein (44). MS1 and MS2 data were extracted using maximum intensity strategy within the given mass tolerance. A dynamic mass tolerance and a correction factor of 1 was used for both MS1 and MS2. The quantification was done at MS2 level, using at least 3 fragments. A global normalization per run was used for cross run normalization based on the median.  For data export from Spectronaut, a peptide-centered export was used. Briefly, columns corresponding to PG. Genes, PG. UNiProtIDs, PG. ProteinNames, PEP. Stripped Sequences, E.G Precurosr ID, EG. ModifiedSequence, PEP. Quantity, EG. Q value, EG. ApexRT, EG. Score and FG. ShapeQualityScore were exported for further investigation. From this export, reverse hits and contaminant peptides were removed in agreement with MQ search prior to data analysis.",

    "description":"Soluble HLA (sHLA) molecules released to the plasma, carry their original peptide cargo and provide insight into the protein synthesis and degradation schemes of their source cells and tissues. Other body fluids, such as pleural effusions, may also contain sHLA-peptide complexes, and can potentially serve as a source of tumor antigens since these fluids are drained from the tumor microenvironment. Thus, we developed a methodology for purifying and analysing large pleural effusion sHLA class I peptidomes of patients inflicted with malignancies or benign diseases. The cleared pleural fluids, the cell pellets present in the pleural effusions, and the primary tumor cells cultured from cancer patients’ effusions, were used for immunoaffinity purification of the HLA molecules. The recovered HLA peptides were analyzed by capillary chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and the resulting LC-MS\/MS data was analyzed with the MaxQuant software tool. Large HLA peptidomes were obtained by the analysis of the pleural effusions. The majority of peptides identified from the pleural effusions were defined as HLA ligands that fit the patients’ HLA consensus sequence motifs. The membranal and soluble HLA peptidomes of each individual patient were somewhat similar to each other. Many of the HLA peptides were derived from known tumor-associated antigens, lung-related proteins, and VEGF pathway proteins. Thus, the pleural effusion HLA peptidome of patients with malignant tumors can serve as a rich source of biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and personalized immunotherapy.",

    "sample_protocol":"HLA molecules were immunoaffinity-purified from the benign and malignant pleural effusions (10-400 ml) and from the available patient plasma sample (10 ml). Briefly, pleural or plasma fluids were centrifuged for 40 min, at 47,808 xg (Sorvall RC 6 Plus centrifuge, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 4℃), and the HLAs in the supernatant were subjected to immunoaffinity purification using pan-HLA-A, -B, and -C monoclonal antibodies (W6\/32) covalently bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads (A2S Technologies, Yavne, Israel). HLA molecules with their bound peptides were eluted using 5 column volumes of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and loaded on disposable C18 microcolumns (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The HLA peptides were recovered by passing 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA over the column, while the HLA molecules and associated proteins were eluted with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The peptide fraction was then dried by vacuum centrifugation, reconstituted in a minimal volume of 0.1% TFA, loaded on C18 StageTips and eluted with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. Samples were dried again by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid. Samples were analyzed by capillary chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). Similarly, the membranal HLA peptidomes were recovered after solubilizing the cell pellets in lysis buffer containing a mild detergent for 45 min at 4℃ before loading on the immunoaffinity column. The lysis buffer contained 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1 mM PMSF, and 1% octyl-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) in cold PBS. HLA purification efficacy was confirmed by western blot using 10% of the 80% acetonitrile sample with the anti-pan HLA class I antibody (ab126237, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The chemoluminescence was detected using the WesternBright ECL substrate kit (Advansta, Menlo Park, CA) and developed using the ImageQuant LAS4000 digital imaging system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). LC-MS\/MS analyses of the HLA-bound peptides were performed with a Q-Exactive-Plus mass spectrometer fitted with an Easy nLC 1000 nano-capillary UHPLC (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) as in [20], with slight modifications. Peptides were loaded on a reversed-phase capillary column of about 30 cm long, 75 µM inner diameter, home-packed with 3.5 µM silica RepriSil-Pur C-18-AQ resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 5-35% of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, for 2 hours, at a flow rate of 0.15 μl\/min. The top 10 most intense ions in each full-MS spectrum, with single to triple-charged states, were selected for fragmentation by high-energy collision dissociation (HCD). No fragmentation was performed on peptides with unassigned precursor ion charge states, or charge states of four and above. The normalized collision energy was set to 25%. Full-scan MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m\/z, with a target value of 3×106 ions. For MS2 the resolution was 17,500 at 200 m\/z with a target value 1×10^5. The intensity threshold was set at 6.7×10^3. Maximum injection time of the fragmented masses for both MS1 and MS2 was set to 150 msec. The tryptic peptides from the 80% acetonitrile fraction described above were analyzed in a Q-Exactive-Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fitted with a capillary HPLC (Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano Pump). The tryptic peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate of the gradient program was 0.15 μl\/min, for 2 h. The 10 most intense ions from the first scan event were fragmented by high collision disassociation (HCD), at a relative collision energy of 25. Resolution and target values for both MS1 and MS2 were as described for the HLA peptidome. The intensity threshold was set at 1.7×104. Maximum injection time of the fragmented masses was set to 20 msec for MS1 and 60 msec for MS2.",
    "data_protocol":"Mass spectrometry data were analyzed by MaxQuant version 1.6.10.43 and searched with the Andromeda search engine using the human UniProt database (https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/; downloaded on June 2019, containing 74,416 entries). We also included a list of mutations available from some patients to identify possibly mutated peptides (yet, no mutated peptides were identified). All samples derived from each patient were analyzed together with the MaxQuant’s match-between-runs option allowed per patient. Mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm for the precursor masses and 20 ppm for the fragments were allowed. Minimal peptide length was seven amino acids. To maximize the number of identified HLA ligands, both 0.05 and 0.01 false discovery rates (FDR) were applied for the peptide spectrum matches. Methionine oxidation, N-acetylation and carbamidomethylation were accepted as variable modifications. For 0.01 FDR, N-deamidation was accepted as another variable modification. Using 0.05 FDR increased the numbers of HLA ligands by about two-fold. The resulting peptide lists were filtered to discard peptides identified in the reverse database, and common contaminants. Peptides were considered potential HLA class I ligands if they were 8-14 amino-acids-long and matched the HLA allele consensus motifs of each patient, based on their tissue typing and online analysis with the NetMHCpan 4.1 server (http:\/\/www.cbs.dtu.dk\/services\/NetMHCpan\/). Peptides that were ranked ≤2 were included in the subsequent data analyses.The raw MS files of the tryptically-digested 80% acetonitrile fractions were also analyzed by MaxQuant version 1.6.10.43 and searched with the Andromeda search engine [21] using the human UniProt database (https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/; downloaded on June 2019). To improve identification rates, each patient’s sample was analyzed separately and the protein sequences of the HLA allomorphs were removed from the database. Only the patient-specific HLA amino acid sequences were inserted as a separate FASTA file obtained from the IPD-IMGT\/HLA database (https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ipd\/imgt\/hla\/). The search settings were trypsin-specific, with FDR set to 0.01 and decoy mode to revert. Methionine oxidation and N-acetylation were accepted as variable modifications, while carbamidomethylation was accepted as a fixed modification. Intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) was used to quantify the levels of purified HLA-peptide complexes.",

More specifically, it refers to the science of investigating the composition of peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules using mass spectrometry (MS) technology platforms. Among all the steps in a MS-based immunopeptidomic workflow, sample preparationis critically important for capturing high-quality data of therapeutic relevance. Here, we describe step-by-step instructions to isolate MHC class I and II-associated peptides by immunoaffinity purification from quality control (QC) samples. Our QC samples are MHC class I and class II peptides isolated from mouse (EL4 and A20) and human (JY) cell lines. We thoroughly describe the various reagents and specfic antibodies that are used too isolate MHC-associated peptides from these cell lines, including the steps to verify the beads-binding efficiency of the antibody and the elution efficiency of the MHC-peptide complexes from the beads. QC samples generated using the described protocol can be used to establish and standardize immunopeptidomic workflow, as well as to benchmark new protocols. We anticipate that the visualized protocol provided in this report will represent a great starting point for any non-expert in addition to foster the instra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility of the sample preparation procedure in immunopeptidomics.",

    "description":"One key barrier to improving efficacy of personalized cancer immunotherapies that are dependent on the tumor antigenic landscape remains patient stratification. While patients with CD3+CD8+ T cell inflamed tumors typically show better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, it is still unknown if the repertoire of HLA bound peptides presented in highly inflamed and non-inflamed tumors is substantially different. We surveyed 61 tumor regions and adjacent non-malignant lung tissues from eight lung cancer patients and performed deep antigen discovery combining immunopeptidomics, genomics, bulk and spatial transcriptomics and explored the heterogeneous expression and presentation of tumor (neo)antigens. Here we associated diverse immune cell populations with the immunopeptidome in CD3+CD8+ T cell excluded, infiltrated, highly- and lowly-inflamed tumors. We found evidence for lower immune-editing and higher presentation efficiency of tumor-associated antigens in lowly-inflamed and CD3+CD8+ T cell excluded tumors. This could have implications for the choice of combination therapies tailored to the patient’s mutanome and microenvironment.",

For HLA immunopurification, we employed the Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor (Waters) and 96-well single-use filter micro-plates with 3 µm glass fibers and 25 µm polyethylene membranes (Agilent, 204495-100). The lysates were passed sequentially through the first plate with wells containing Pro-A beads for endogenous antibody depletion, then a second plate with wells containing anti-pan HLA-I antibody-cross-linked beads, and lastly through the third plate containing anti-pan HLA-II antibody-cross-linked beads. The HLA-I and HLA-II crosslinked beads were then washed separately in their plates with varying concentrations of salts using the processor. Finally, the beads were washed twice with 2 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Sep-Pak tC18 100 mg Sorbent 96-well plates (Waters, ref no: 186002321) were used for the purification and concentration of HLA-I and HLA-II peptides. The C18 sorbents were conditioned, and the HLA complexes and bound peptides were directly eluted from the filter plates with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Sigma Aldrich). After washing the C18 sorbents with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA, HLA-I peptides were eluted with 28% acetonitrile (ACN; Sigma Aldrich) in 0.1% TFA, and HLA-II peptides were eluted with 32% ACN in 0.1% TFA. Recovered HLA-I and -II peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator plus, Eppendorf) and stored at −20 °C. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) analyses The LC-MS\/MS system consisted of an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 450 mm analytical column (8 µm tip, 75 µm inner diameter, PicoTipTMEmitter, New Objective) packed with ReproSil-Pur C18 (1.9 µm particles, 120 Å pore size, Dr. Maisch GmbH). The separation was performed at a flow rate of 250 nL\/min by a gradient of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in 80% ACN (solvent B) in 0.1% FA in water (solvent A). HLAIp were analyzed by the following gradient: 0–5 min (5% B); 5–85 min (5–35% B); 85–100 min (35–60% B); 100–105 min (60–95% B); 105–110 min (95% B); 110–115 min (95–2% B) and 115–125 min (2% B). HLAIIp were analyzed by the following gradient: 0–5 min (2–5% B); 5–65 min (5–30% B); 65–70 min (30–60% B); 70–75 min (60–95% B); 75–80 min (95% B), 80–85 min (95–2% B) and 85–90 min (2% B). For data dependent acquisition, full MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap from m\/z = 300–1650 with a resolution of 60,000 (m\/z = 200) and an ion accumulation time of 80 ms. The auto gain control (AGC) was set to 3e6 ions. MS\/MS spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner on the 20 most abundant precursor ions (if present) with a resolution of 15,000 (m\/z = 200), an ion accumulation time of 120 ms, and an isolation window of 1.2 m\/z. The AGC was set to 2e5 ions, the dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s, and a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27 was used for fragmentation. No fragmentation was performed for HLAIp with assigned precursor ion charge states of four and above or for HLAIIp with an assigned precursor ion charge state of one, or six and above. The peptide match option was disabled. Data was acquired in an independent manner using the following parameters. The cycle of acquisition consisted of a full MS scan from 300-1650 m\/z (R = 60,000 and ion accumulation time of 60 ms) and 21 DIA MS\/MS scans in the Orbitrap. For each DIA MS\/MS scan, a resolution of 30,000, an AGC of 3e6 and a ramping normalized collision energy (NCE = 25.5, 27 and 30) were used. The maximum ion accumulation was set to auto and the overlap between consecutive MS\/MS scans was 1 m\/z. For some peptide samples, only DDA measurements were available.",
    "data_protocol":"MS-based searches First, for each region, we search the corresponding MS raw file against the a personalized proteome reference as described above using Comet with the following setup: precursor mass tolerance 20 ppm, MS\/MS fragment tolerance of 0.02 Da, peptide length of 8–15 when searching only HLA-I peptides and 8–25 for both HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, no fixed modifications, while methionine oxidation and  phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine was included as a variable modification.  A group specific 3% FDR (smoothing value: 5) for protein-coding, non-canonical sources and transposable elements) was calculated by NewAnce v1.7.1 (smoothing value: 5) as previously described.  We next generated a single comprehensive reference database containing all the protein sequence sources of the detected personalized variant and non-canonical peptides from all patient tissue regions, and concatenate these to a generic GENCODE database. Then, Comet and NewAnce searches were run again against this database using the entire immunopeptidomics dataset, yet separately for HLA-I and HLA-II raw files with same parameters as above. The outputs of this search were used to create spectral libraries for targeted DIA analysis with Spectronaut.  The spectral libraries were generated using the results from the Comet and NewAnce search by parsing the PSMs into the BGS generic format recommended by Spectronaut (version 14.6.2, Biognosys). The default settings were used except the following parameters. For the mass tolerance, the calibration search was set to ‘dynamic’ and a correction factor of 1 was used for MS and MS\/MS. For identification, a FDR threshold of 0.01 and unspecific digestion rule were used. For spectral library filtering, only peptides with longer than 3 a.a and with at least 3 best fragments (up to 6) were considered. A deep learning assisted iRT regression and a R-square of 0.8 were used for iRT reference strategy and correlation score, respectively. The selection of fragment ions based on intensity was used. For targeted DIA based identification of the peptides, the library was matched against the corresponding immunopeptidomics DIA raw files with q-value cut-off of 0.01 and 1 respectively for precursor and protein. MS and MS\/MS data were extracted using maximum intensity strategy within the given mass tolerance. A dynamic mass tolerance and a correction factor of 1 were used for both MS and MS\/MS. The quantification was done at MS\/MS level, using at least 3 fragments. The global normalization per run based on the median was switched off to avoid cross run normalization. Results from Spectronaut were exported in peptide-centered file formats: peptide quantity and peptide score.  For more extended analysis of HLA-I peptides derived from non-canonical sources, we used the  high-confidence database of translated nuORFs across tissues (nuORFdb) (concatenated with the human reference proteome; 323,848 entries, PA_nuORFdb_v1.0.fasta) and a reduced version of the above mentioned  personalized references per patient, where the ORFs non-canonical sources were restricted to in silico methionine-to-stop translated transcript entries, resulting in fasta files with overall similar size per patient (ranging from 521,779 entries for patient 02672 to 599,300 entries for patient 02287). We then used the hybrid DIA approach with Spectronaut (version 16.3: The parameters are provided in Supplementary software 1). Peptide identification was performed by PulsarTM on DIA and DDA files (separately per patient) using unspecific digestion and with a peptide length from 8 – 15a.a. Acetylation at Protein N-term and Oxidation of methionine were considered as variable modifications. –b and y ions were used as main ion types. For non-canonical sources, we used the gencode annotation with priorities in the following order: lncRNAs, processed transcripts, pseudogenes, retained introns, noncanonical ORFs and ‘others’.",

    "description":"ost characterized tumor antigens are ‘genomic’, i.e. encoded by canonical, non-canonical or somatically mutated genomic sequences. We investigate here the presentation and immunogenicity of tumor antigens derived from non-canonical mRNA splicing events between coding exons and transposable elements (TEs). Comparing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an immunogenic tumor type, and diverse non-tumor tissues, we identify several thousand splicing junctions between exons and diverse TE classes. A subset of these junctions is both tumor-specific and shared across patients. HLA-I peptidomic identifies peptides encoded by tumor-specific junctions in primary NSCLC samples and lung tumor cell lines. Recurrent junction-encoded peptides are immunogenic in vitro and CD8+ T cells specific for junction-encoded epitopes are present in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes from NSCLC patients. We conclude that non-canonical splicing junctions between exons and TEs represent a source of recurrent, immunogenic tumor-specific antigens in NSCLC cancer patients.",

    "description":"Identification of CD8+ T-cell epitopes is critical for the development of immunotherapeutics. Existing methods for MHC-I ligand discovery are time-intensive, specialized and unable to interrogate specific proteins on a large scale. Here we present EpiScan, which uses surface MHC-I levels as a readout for whether a genetically encoded peptide is an MHC-I ligand. Oligonucleotide synthesis permits facile screening for MHC-I ligands amongst predetermined starting pools comprising >100,000 peptides. We exploit this programmability of EpiScan to uncover an unappreciated role for cysteine that increases the number of predicted ligands by 12-21%, reveal affinity hierarchies by analysis of biased-anchor peptide libraries, and screen viral proteomes for MHC-I ligands. Using these data, we generate and iteratively refine peptide binding prediction predictions to create EpiScan Predictor, or ESP.  ESP performed comparably to other state-of-the-art MHC-I peptide binding prediction algorithms while not suffering from underrepresentation of cysteine-containing peptides.  Thus, targeted immunopeptidomics using EpiScan will accelerate CD8+ T-cell epitope discovery towards the goal of patient-specific immunotherapeutics.",

    "description":"Systemic pan-tumor analyses may reveal the significance of common features implicated in cancer immunogenicity and patient survival. Here, we provide a comprehensive multi-omics data set for 32 patients across 25 tumor types for proteogenomic-based discovery of neoantigens. By using an optimized computational approach, we discover a large number of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens. To create a pipeline for the identification of neoantigens in our cohort, we combine DNA and RNA sequencing with MS-based immunopeptidomics of tumor specimens, followed by the assessment of their immunogenicity and an in-depth validation process. We detect a broad variety of non-canonical HLA-binding peptides in the majority of patients demonstrating partially immunogenicity. Our validation process allows for the selection of 32 potential neoantigen candidates. The majority of neoantigen candidates originates from variants identified in the RNA data set, illustrating the relevance of RNA as a still understudied source of cancer antigens. This study underlines the importance of RNA-centered variant detection for the identification of shared biomarkers and potentially relevant neoantigen candidates.",

    "sample_protocol":"Immunoprecipitation of HLA complexes, consequent elution and purification of peptide ligands was performed as previously described (Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2016). Briefly, snap-frozen human tumor tissue samples were placed in 5-7 ml of PBS with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% octyl-β-D glucopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, and 1:200 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and mechanically dissociated with an ULTRA-TURRAX Disperser (IKA) for 10 s on ice, followed by 1 h incubation at 4°C. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 40,000g at 4 °C for 20 min and flowed through columns packed with protein-A Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) to deplete the endogenous antibodies. HLA class I complexes were immunoaffinity-purified from the cleared and antibody-depleted lysates on columns containing protein-A Sepharose beads covalently bound to 2 mg of the pan-HLA class I antibody W6\/32 (purified from HB95 cells; ATCC) and eluted at room temperature with 0.1 N acetic acid. The eluted HLA-I complexes were then loaded onto Sep-Pak tC18 cartridges (Waters Corporation), and HLA-I peptides were separated from the complexes by elution with 30% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Peptides were further purified using Silica C-18 column tips (Harvard Apparatus), eluted again with 30% ACN in 0.1% TFA and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation. Finally, HLA-I peptides were resuspended with 2% ACN in 0.1% TFA for LC-MS\/MS analysis. LC-MS\/MS analysis was performed on an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online with a nanoelectrospray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to a QExactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded in buffer A (0.1% formic acid) on a 50 cm long, 75 µm inner diameter column, in-house packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 µm resin (Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH), and eluted during a 95 min linear gradient of 5-30% buffer B (80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nl\/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode with the Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific). Full MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 at 200 m\/z and AGC target value of 3e6 with a maximum injection time of 80 ms. The ten most abundant ions with charge 1-4 were accumulated to an AGC target value of 1e5 and for a maximum injection time of 120 ms and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). MS\/MS scans were acquired with a resolution of 15,000 at 200 m\/z and 20 s dynamic exclusion to reduce repeated peptide selection.",
    "data_protocol":"For the identification of all peptide sequences from the MS spectra, pFIND (v.3.1.5) was used to match the reference protein database (Human Ensembl GRCh38, release 92) with general contaminants to the generated spectra files. Parameters were set to search for non-specifically digested peptides ranging from 8-15mers with a maximum mass of 1,500 Da and N-terminal protein acetylation (42.010565 Da), methionine oxidation (15.994915 Da), cysteine carbamidomethylation (57.021463 Da) as possible post-translational modifications. Identified peptides were filtered with an FDR of 0.01 at the peptide spectrum match level.  For the identification of mutated HLA class I peptides, the reference protein database (Human Ensembl GRCh38, release 92) was searched together with a patient-specific customized databases containing mutated amino acid sequences based on each tumor mutational profile. Therefore, mutations called from WES\/WGS and RNAseq of the patient tumor samples were introduced into the wildtype transcript DNA sequences downloaded from biomart (v92) and translated into peptide sequences. Genes were included in the analysis without exceptions regarding the transcript biotypes. For non-protein-coding transcripts, ORFs enclosing the mutation site were determined by identifying paired start and stop-codons in all 3 reading frames. The same procedure was performed for protein-coding transcripts in case of start\/stop-loss\/gain and frameshift mutations. Furthermore, for start\/stop mutations, the coding sequence (CDS) was extended into the corresponding UTR. For mutations affecting splice donor or acceptor sites, the affected intron was included into the CDS and again checked for valid ORFs. Only mutations resulting in amino acid changes and within valid ORFs were considered. For every affected transcript, up to three ORFs enclosing the mutation site were translated into the corresponding mutated peptide sequence.  Peptide sequences were then used as a reference data for mutated peptide identification from the MS data using pFIND (v.3.1.5). Parameters were set to search for non-specifically digested peptides ranging from 8-15mers with a maximum mass of 1,500 Da and N-terminal acetylation (42.010565 Da), methionine oxidation (15.994915 Da), cysteine carbamidomethylation (57.021463 Da) as possible post-translational modifications and a set FDR of 0.05 at the peptide spectrum match level.",

    "description":"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide for which no sufficiently protective vaccine exists. CD8+ T cells contribute to protective immunity to TB, but the antigenic targets presented on MHC-I by macrophages infected with virulent Mtb for recognition by CD8+ T cells have not been conclusively defined. Here, we use mass spectrometry to directly identify Mtb-derived peptides presented on MHC class I (MHC-I) by infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. We identified 16 MHC-I peptides derived from 12 Mtb proteins, and validated these identifications using internal standard parallel reaction monitoring (SureQuant). Our results show that this set of antigens is highly enriched for substrates of type VII secretion systems (T7SS) relative to the Mtb proteome. Our results identify specific Mtb proteins that may be suitable targets for subunit vaccines designed to elicit protective CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity and suggest that T7SS substrates may be a fruitful class of antigens to prioritize for further vaccine target discovery efforts. Note: donors labeled A, C, D, E, H, and I in file names here are renamed sequentially (A, B, C, D, E, and F) in the manuscript describing this study to avoid confusion.",

Isolated monocytes were differentiated in R10 media [RPMI 1640 without phenol red (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco), 1% HEPES (Corning), 1% L-glutamine (Sigma)] supplemented with 25 ng\/mL M-CSF (Biolegend, 572902). 50 million monocytes per condition were cultured on ultra-low-attachment T75 flasks (Corning) for 6 days. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv was grown in Difco Middlebrook 7H9 media supplemented with 10% OADC, 0.2% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween-80 to mid-log phase. The Mtb culture was pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, resuspended in R10 media and filtered through a 5 μm syringe filter to obtain a single-cell suspension. Macrophages were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 2.5 for 4 h and then washed with PBS to remove extracellular Mtb.

Beads were washed with 500 μL of TBS (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), then twice more with 500 μL HPLC-grade water. Peptide-MHC complexes were eluted by incubating beads in 10% acetic acid for 20 minutes at room temperature. Peptides were isolated from antibody and MHC protein using a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter (Pall Nanosep) (donors A, C, D) or C18 SpinTips (Protea) (donors E, H, and I). SpinTips were washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, activated with 90% acetonitrile supplemented with 0.1% formic acid, and washed with 0.1% formic acid. Eluate from MHC-I IPs was applied to the column by centrifugation. The column was washed with 0.1% formic acid, and peptides were eluted by applying elution solvent (30% acetonitrile supplemented with 0.1% formic acid) by centrifugation twice. Eluates were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized.

Peptides were fractionated using an Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatograph using buffers A2 (10 mM TEAB, pH 8.0) and B2 (99% acetonitrile, 10 mM TEAB, pH 8.0). The fractionation column was washed with solvent A2, and peptides were separated using a gradient of 1-5% solvent B2 over 5 minutes, 5-40% over 60 minutes, 40-70% over 10 minutes, hold for 9 minutes, and 70%-1% over 1 minute. 90-second fractions were collected, concatenated into 12 tubes, over 90 minutes in total. Fractions were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. 75% of sample was used for DDA analysis. 25% was reserved for validation by SureQuant.",
    "data_protocol":"All mass spectra were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer (PD, version 2.5) and searched using Mascot (version 2.4) against a custom database comprising the Uniprot human proteome (UP000005640) and the Uniprot Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv proteome (UP000001584). No enzyme was used, and variable modifications included oxidized methionine for all analyses. Peptide-spectrum matches from all analyses were filtered with the following criteria: search engine rank = 1, isolation interference ≤ 30%, length between 8 and 16 amino acids, ions score ≥ 15, and Percolator q-value < 0.05. Identifications (IDs) of putative Mtb-derived peptides were rejected if any peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) for the same peptide were found in the unfiltered DDA MS data for the corresponding mock-infected control. For each putative Mtb peptide identified, MS\/MS spectra and extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) were manually inspected, and the ID was only accepted for further validation if it met the following criteria: (1) MS\/MS spectra contained enough information to unambiguously assign a majority of the peptide sequence; (2) neutral losses were consistent with the chemical properties of the peptide; (3) manual de novo sequencing did not reveal an alternate peptide sequence that would explain a greater number of MS\/MS spectrum peaks; (4) XIC showed a peak in MS intensity at the mass to charge ratio (m\/z) of the peptide precursor ion at the retention time at which it was identified that did not appear in the corresponding mock-infected control. Peptides that met these criteria were further validated using SureQuant. DDA MS data were searched a second time against a database comprising only known T7SS substrates of Mtb H37Rv (all Esx-family proteins, all PE\/PPE proteins, and EspA, EspB, EspC, EspE, EspF, EspI, EspJ, and EspK). Because using this limited database artificially raises Percolator q-values, these searches were filtered only on ions score ≥ 20 rather than on ions score ≥ 15 and Percolator q-value < 0.05. The only validated Mtb peptide identified via these additional searches that had not previously been identified (AEHGMPGVP, derived from PPE51) was omitted from enrichment analyses to avoid introducing bias.",

    "description":"CD8+ T cells contribute to protective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but the principles that govern presentation of Mtb peptides on MHC class I (MHC-I) on the surface of infected macrophages for CD8+ T cell recognition are incompletely understood. Here, we use internal standard parallel reaction monitoring (IS-PRM, also known as SureQuant) to rigorously validate identifications of Mtb-derived MHC-I peptides obtained in data-dependent MS analyses. We further use SureQuant to quantify presentation of Mtb peptides derived from the secreted effector proteins EsxA and EsxJ across multiple experimental conditions. We show that presentation of both EsxA- and EsxJ-derived peptides requires the activity of the mycobacterial ESX-1 type VII secretion system, possibly indicating that ESX-1-mediated phagosome membrane damage allows Mtb proteins to access MHC-I antigen processing pathways. We show that this requirement is independent of type I interferon signaling that occurs downstream of phagosome damage. Treatment with inhibitors of conventional proteolytic pathways involved in MHC-I antigen processing inhibits presentation of self peptides as expected, but does not inhibit presentation of Mtb peptides, implying an alternative or redundant mechanism of processing.",

    "title":"PRAME and CTCFL-reactive TCRs for the treatment of ovarian cancer",
    "description":"Recurrent disease emerges in the majority of patients with ovarian cancer (OVCA). Adoptive T-cell therapies with T-cell receptors (TCRs) targeting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are considered promising solutions for less-immunogenic ‘cold’ ovarian tumors. In order to treat a broader patient population, more TCRs targeting peptides derived from different TAAs binding in various HLA class I molecules are essential. By performing a differential gene expression analysis using mRNA-seq datasets, PRAME, CTCFL and CLDN6 were selected as strictly tumor-specific TAAs, with high expression in ovarian cancer and at least 20-fold lower expression in all healthy tissues of risk. In primary OVCA patient samples and cell lines we confirmed expression and identified naturally expressed TAA-derived peptides in the HLA class I ligandome. Subsequently, high-avidity T-cell clones recognizing these peptides were isolated from the allo-HLA T-cell repertoire of healthy individuals. Three PRAME TCRs and one CTCFL TCR of the most promising T-cell clones were sequenced, and transferred to CD8+ T cells. The PRAME TCR-T cells demonstrated potent and specific antitumor reactivity in vitro and in vivo. The CTCFL TCR-T cells efficiently recognized primary patient-derived OVCA cells, and OVCA cell lines treated with demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC). The identified PRAME and CTCFL TCRs are promising candidates for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer, and are an essential addition to the currently used HLA-A*02:01 restricted PRAME TCRs. Our selection of differentially expressed genes, naturally expressed TAA peptides and potent TCRs can improve and broaden the use of T-cell therapies for patients with ovarian cancer or other PRAME or CTCFL expressing cancers.",

    "description":"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a crucial role in the development of adaptive immune responses and therefore have been of major interest in the development of immunotherapies such as cancer vaccines and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Hence, a comprehensive understanding and profiling of the immunopeptidome is required to foster growth for these personalised solutions. We herein describe a novel immunopeptidomics workflow involving the Kingfisher platform (Thermo Scientific) to isolate immunopeptidomes with anti-HLA antibodies coupled to a proprietary hyper-porous protein A microparticle (MagReSyn®), and a modified variable window data independent acquisition (DIA) method. Using the workflow, we were able to identify ~1500 peptides in as low as 5e6 cells. Overall, the robustness of this workflow will be very important for the future of the immunopeptidome profiling, especially for smaller sample types, and will be a useful tool for the development of immunotherapies and other precision medicine approaches.",

    "title":"Immunopeptidomics-based identification of naturally presented non-canonical circRNA-derived peptides",
    "description":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed non-coding RNAs lacking the 5’ cap and the poly-A tail. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that certain circRNAs can undergo active translation. Therefore, aberrantly expressed circRNAs in human cancers could be an unexplored source of tumor-specific antigens, potentially mediating anti-tumor T cell responses. This study presents an immunopeptidomics workflow with a specific focus on generating a circRNA-specific protein fasta reference. The main goal of this workflow is to streamline the process of identifying and validating human leukocyte antigen (HLA) bound peptides potentially originating from circRNAs. We increased the analytical stringency of our workflow by retaining peptides identified independently by two mass spectrometry search engines and\/or by applying a group-specific FDR for canonical-derived and circRNA-derived peptides. A subset of circRNA-derived peptides specifically encoded by the region spanning the back-splice junction (BSJ) were validated with targeted MS, and with direct Sanger sequencing of the respective source transcripts. Our workflow identified 54 unique BSJ-spanning circRNA-derived peptides in the immunopeptidome of melanoma and lung cancer samples. Our novel approach enlarges the catalog of source proteins that can be explored for immunotherapy.",

    "sample_protocol":"Purification of HLA-I peptides and LC-MS\/MS Analysis: HLA-I immunoprecipitation was performed according to our previous established protocols6, 64. Shortly, protein-A Sepharose 4B (Pro-A) beads (Invitrogen) were used to purify W6\/32 monoclonal antibodies from the supernatant of HB95 hybridoma cells (ATCC HB-95). After antibody crosslinking, Pro-A beads were used for immunoaffinity purification of HLA-I complexes from tissue or cell line lysates. HLA-I peptides were then purified using a C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) and dried using vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator plus, Eppendorf). Samples were stored at -80°C if not immediately submitted to mass spectrometry analysis. Finally, immunopeptides were re-suspended in 2% ACN and 0.1% FA (formic acid). iRT peptides (Biognosis, Schlieren, Switzerland) were spiked into in the samples (Biognosis) as indicated in Supplementary Table 7 and analyzed by LC-MS\/MS. :Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS): The LC-MS system consisted of an Easy-nLC 1200 coupled to Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher scientific, Bremen, Germany) or to Eclipse tribrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, USA). The peptides were eluted on a 450mm analytical column (8 m tip, 75 m ID) packed with ReproSil-Pur C18 (1.9 m particle size, 120 A pore size, Dr Maisch, GmbH) and separated at a flow rate of 250 nL\/min as described64. For DDA measurements, the top 20 most abundant precursor ions selection was performed on the Q Exactive as described64. For DIA, the Eclipse tribrid mass spectrometer was used to samples ions. The cycle of acquisitions consists of a full MS scan from 300 to 1650 m\/z (R = 120,000, ion accumulation time of 60 ms and normalized AGC of 250%) and 22 DIA MS\/MS scans in the orbitrap. For each DIA MS\/MS scan, a resolution of 30,000, a normalized AGC of 250%, and a stepped normalized collision energy (27, 30, and 32) were used. The maximum ion accumulation was set to auto, the fixed first mass was set to 200 m\/z, and the overlap between consecutive MS\/MS scans was 1 m\/z as described79.",
    "data_protocol":"DDA MS search with group-specific FDR: MS-derived raw files resultant from three biological replicates of T1185B (Supplementary Table 7) were searched using MaxQuant51 (version 2.1.0.0) with a PSM FDR of 0.1 and Comet52 against the generated reference fasta file containing both UniProt and the trimmed circRNA-derived putative ORFs around the BSJ and initiated by the canonical start codon ATG. Outputs were then intersected by NewAnce (v1.6) setting a group-specific FDR of 0.03 for protein- and circRNA-derived peptides. The search was done setting a nonspecific protein digestion cleavage, no fixed modifications, methionine oxidation and protein N-term acetylation as variable modifications, and restricting the peptide length to 8-15 amino acids. Same approach was used for the cell line and tumor tissues of patient Mel-1 patient (two biological replicates and three different lymph node regions, respectively). Hybrid DIA MS search: DIA files corresponding to the immunopeptidomics samples of MG132 and IFN treatment of T1185B cells were searched using a hybrid DIA approach using two computational tools, FragPipe (v.20.0) with group-specific FDR calculation57, 60, 82 and Spectronaut (v.18.4)83, against the generated reference fasta file containing both UniProt and the trimmed circRNA-derived ORFs around the BSJ to which a list of common MS contaminant proteins were added. To increase the coverage of the spectral library, we assembled available DDA raw files from T1185B cells treated or not with IFN (from the PRIDE accession PXD0136496), the newly generated DDA data, together with the DIA files of T1185B cells treated with MG132 and the new IFN treatments (and their respective controls), as indicated in Supplementary Table 7. In FragPipe we applied a group-specific FDR threshold of 0.03 (MSFragger Group variable: Protein evidence from FASTA file) while in Spectronaut we applied a global peptide FDR threshold of 0.01. In both engines, the search was done by applying a FDR threshold of 1 for proteins, nonspecific protein digestion cleavage, no fixed modifications, methionine oxidation and protein N-term acetylation as variable modifications, and restricting the peptide length to 8-15 amino acids. Hybrid spectral libraries were then used to match and quantify peptides from the immunopeptidomics DIA data using a peptide precursor group-specific FDR of 0.03 for FragPipe or global FDR of 0.01 for Spectronaut. Default decoy generation methods were used for each MS search tool, reversed and mutated sequences for FragPipe and Spectronaut, respectively. Data analysis was performed using Fragpipe quantification values after overlapping identified sequences from both FragPipe and Spectronaut MS analysis tools. DDA-DIA MS search with group-specific FDR calculation: HLA-I and HLA-II raw files of the lung cancer cohort of 8 patients and 52 tumoral and healthy matched tissues62 (Supplementary Table 7) were downloaded from PRIDE PXD034772 and analyzed by FragPipe (v.19.2-build39 for HLA-I and v.20.0 for HLA-II immunopeptidomes) which supported group-specific FDR calculation. Spectral library generation was performed using the DDA immunopeptidomics data. The search was done setting a nonspecific protein digestion cleavage, no fixed modifications, methionine oxidation and protein N-term acetylation as variable modifications, a group-specific FDR threshold of 0.03 for peptides (MSFragger Group variable: Protein evidence from FASTA file), a FDR threshold of 1 for proteins, and restricting the peptide length to 8-15 or to 8-25 amino acids for HLA-I or HLA-II MS searches, respectively. Respective spectral libraries were then used to match and quantify peptides from the immunopeptidomics DIA data using a peptide precursor group-specific FDR of 0.03. DIA immunopeptidomics raw files were used for matching and quantification of peptides. Peptides from canonical and non-canonical circRNA groups were used to calculate the FDR separately because the score distributions are different. Pooling them together would result in underestimated FDR for the circRNA group. HLA-I and HLA-II library generation and peptide identification were performed in independent analysis.",

Here, we employed a peptidomic workflow to identify phosphorylated ligands associated with HLA-B*40, -B*27, -B*39 and -B*07. Remarkably, these phosphopeptides showed similar molecular features. Besides the specific anchor motifs imposed by the binding groove of each allotype, the predominance of phosphorylation at peptide position 4 (P4) became strikingly evident, as was the enrichment of basic residues at P1. This molecular understanding of the presentation of phosphopeptides by HLA-B molecules can help in predicting tumor-specific neo-antigens that arise from aberrant phosphorylation in cancer cells.",

The following variable modifications were considered: oxidation of methionine, protein N-terminal acetylation, pyroglutamic acid formation from N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine. For the analysis of the phosphoproteome of C1R-B*40 cells, trypsin was selected as enzyme allowing up to 2 missed cleavages. The variable modifications specified were: oxidation of methionine, protein N-terminal acetylation, pyroglutamic acid formation from N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine. The individual outputs of the search engines were combined by converting each engine-specific scoring scheme to a common probability-based scale as previously described (Ramos-Fernández et al.

    "description":"The HLA-B*27 peptidome has drawn significant attention due to the genetic association between some of the HLA-B*27 alleles and the inflammatory rheumatic disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The role of HLA-B*27 in this condition is not known yet. This study aims to expand the known limits of the HLA-B*27 peptidome in order to facilitate selection and testing of new peptides, possibly implicated with the disease. The HLA peptidomes of HeLa and C1R cell lines stably transfected with the AS-associated HLA-B*27:05 allele, the non-associated HLA-B*27:09 allele, or their mutants with Cysteine 67 replaced by Serine (C67S), were analyzed on a very large scale. In addition, the peptidomes of HLA-B*27:05 and HLA-B*27:05-C67S were analyzed from transgenic rats’ spleens. The results indicate that a fraction of HLA-B*27 peptides contain lysine at their second position (P2), in addition to the more commonly found peptides with arginine, or the less common glutamine located at this anchor position. Furthermore, the C67S mutation increases the percentages of peptides with glutamine or lysine at their P2 position, in both HLA-B*27:05 and HLA-B*27:09. Therefore, peptides with P2 lysine should be considered as valid ligands of HLA-B*27 molecules and taken into account while looking for candidate for arithrogenic peptides.",

Both the spleens and cultured cells were solubilized in solubilization buffer containing, in addition to PBS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Octyl-β-D glucopyranoside, 1:200 Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340) and 1 mM PMSF. Solubilization was continued by gentle mixing on ice for 60 minutes. The HLAs from the cultured cells’ pellets and splenic extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 60 min at 4ºC and 48,000g.  For each preparation of soluble HLA molecules, about one liter of growth medium containing the sHLA molecules was clarified by centrifugation for 60 min at 4ºC and 18,000g. HLA molecules were immunoaffinity-purified using either the B1.23.2 mAb covalently linked to Protein A Agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or the ME1 mAb linked to Protein G Agarose (ABT, Madrid, Spain).  The HLA molecules with their bound peptides were eluted from the immunoaffinity columns with 1% TFA. The released peptides were separated from the HLA heavy chain, the β2m, and other co-purified proteins using step elution from reversed-phase MicroTip C18 columns (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), with 0.1% TFA and 30% acetonitrile to collect the HLA peptides and then with 0.1% TFA and 80% acetonitrile to collect the HLA heavy chains and other co-purifying proteins.  LC-MS\/MS analysis of the HLA and the tryptic peptides: The recovered HLA heavy chains with their other co-purifying protein fraction were dried and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were identified after cutting the gel lanes into four gel slices and in-gel proteolysis. The recovered HLA peptides and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC-MS\/MS using capillaries of 0.075 mm ID and about 20 cm long, packed with C18 reversed-phase 3.5 micron beads(Reprosil-C18-Aqua, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). Chromatography was performed with the UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano-capillary UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coupled by electrospray to Q-Exactive-Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer, run with the same parameters. The HLA peptides were eluted with a linear gradient over two hours from 5 to 28% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, at a flow rate of 0.15 μl\/min. Data was acquired using a data-dependent ‘top 10’ method, fragmenting the peptides by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). The full scan MS spectra were acquired at resolution of 70,000 at 200 m\/z with a target value of 3x106 ions. Ions were accumulated to AGC target value of 105 with maximum injection time of 100 msec.

    "description":"Imunopeptidomes promise novel surface markers as ideal targets for immunotherapies, but their characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) remains challenging. Until recently, cell numbers exceeding 1.0xE9 were needed for reasonably deep immunopeptidome surveys of at least 1,000 HLA ligands. Such limitation in analytical sensitivity necessarily constrains the types of clinical specimens that can evaluated. To evaluate the feasibility of immunopeptidome profiling from limiting cell amounts, primary purified human regulatory (Treg) and conventional T cells (Tconv) were compared, evaluating the relative immunopeptide recovery from T cells isolated from individual healthy donors (N=5) versus pools (N=2 pools from 13 donors). Two donors’ Tconv were subsequently stimulated with CD3\/CD28 and IL-2 and compared to resting Tconv. The combined T-cell immunopeptide dataset reported here contains over 13,000 unique peptides derived from over 5,000 proteins. In comparison to protein expression, T cell immunopeptidomes revealed complementary aspects of T cell biology, while pointing to HLA ligands specific for distinct T cell subsets (e.g., FOXP3, CD5 and WNK1). Taken together, these findings have implications for understanding conditions required to induce therapeutic immune responses and may open up new avenues for tuning Treg suppressive functions to treat cancer.",

    "description":"Most high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and recur, but 15% remain disease-free over a decade. To discover drivers of long-term survival, we quantitatively analyzed the proteomes of platinum resistant and sensitive HGSOC patients from minute amounts of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. This revealed cancer\/testis antigen 45 (CT45) as an independent prognostic factor associated with a doubling of disease-free survival in advanced stage HGSOC. Phospho- and interaction proteomics tied CT45 to DNA damage pathways through direct interaction with the PP4 phosphatase complex. In vitro, CT45 regulated PP4 activity and its high expression led to increased DNA damage and platinum sensitivity. CT45-derived HLA class I peptides, identified by immunopeptidomics, activate patient-derived cytotoxic T cells and promote tumor cell killing. This study highlights the power of clinical cancer proteomics to identify targets for chemo- and immunotherapy and illuminate their biological roles.",

Lysis was then carried out in 4% SDS, 10 mM Hepes pH 8.0 at 99°C for 60 min and by 15 min sonication (Bioruptor, Diagenode, Belgium). Proteins in the cleared lysate (16,000 g, 10 min) were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide for an additional 30 min. 100 ug of proteins were purified from SDS by acetone precipitation and the protein pellet resolved in 100 μl 6 M urea\/2 M thiourea (in 10 mM Hepes pH 8.0). LysC digestion was carried out with 1 μg of LysC for 3 h at room temperature. After adding 4 volumes of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, 1 μg trypsin was added for tryptic digestion overnight.

    "title":"Substantial Influence of ERAP2 on the HLA-B*40:02 peptidome. Implications for HLA-B*27-negative ankylosing spondylitis.",
    "description":"HLA-B*40:02 is one of a few Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) independently of HLA-B*27. The endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2), an enzyme that process MHC-I ligands and preferentially trims N-terminal basic residues, is also a risk factor for this disease. Like HLA-B*27 and other AS-associated MHC-I molecules, HLA-B*40:02 binds a relatively high percentage of peptides with ERAP2-susceptible residues. In this study the effects of ERAP2 depletion on the HLA-B*40:02 peptidome were analyzed. ERAP2 protein expression was knocked out by CRISPR in the transfectant cell line C1R-B*40:02 and the differences between the peptidomes from the wildtype and ERAP2-KO cells were determined by label-free quantitative comparisons. The qualitative changes dependent on ERAP2 affected about 5% of the peptidome, but quantitative changes in peptide amounts were much more substantial, reflecting a significant influence of this enzyme on the generation\/destruction balance of HLA-B*40:02 ligands. As in HLA-B*27, a major effect was on the frequencies of N-terminal residues. In this position basic and small residues were increased in the absence of ERAP2 and aliphatic\/aromatic residues were increased in the presence of the enzyme. Since most of the non-B*27 MHC-I molecules associated with AS risk also bind a relatively high percentage of peptides with N-terminal basic residues we hypothesize that the non-epistatic association of ERAP2 with AS might be related to the processing of peptides with these residues bound by AS-associated MHC-I molecules.",

    "description":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptides play a critical role in immune cell recognition and can trigger an antitumor immune response in cancer. Surface MHC levels can be modulated by anticancer agents, altering immunity. However, understanding the peptide repertoire response to treatment remains challenging and is limited by quantitative mass spectrometry-based strategies lacking robust normalization controls.  We describe a novel approach that leverages recombinant heavy isotope-coded peptide MHCs (hipMHCs) and multiplex isotope tagging to quantify peptide repertoire alterations using low sample input. HipMHCs improve quantitative accuracy of peptide repertoire changes by normalizing for variation across analyses and enable absolute quantification using internal calibrants to determine copies per cell of MHC antigens, which can inform targeted and combination immunotherapy design. Applying this platform to profile the immunopeptidome response to CDK4\/6 inhibition and Interferon gamma, known modulators of antigen presentation, uncovered treatment-specific alterations, connecting the intracellular response to extracellular immune presentation.",

    "title":"Anti-tumor immunity induces the presentation of aberrant peptides in melanoma",
    "description":"Many tumors escape by activating multiple cellular pathways that induce immunosuppression. One pivotal immune-suppressive mechanism is the production of tryptophan metabolites along the kynurenine pathway by IFNγ-induced IDO1 enzyme production 4-8. Phase III clinical trials using chemical inhibition of IDO1 in combination with PD1 pathway blockade, however, failed to improve melanoma treatment 9-12. This points at an incomplete understanding of the role of IDO1 and the consequent tryptophan degradation on mRNA translation and cancer progression. Here, we investigated the effects of prolonged IFNγ treatment on mRNA translation in melanoma cells by ribosome profiling. Surprisingly, we observed a massive accumulation of ribosomes ~20 amino acids downstream of tryptophan codons (termed here as W-Bumps) along with their expected stalling at the tryptophan codon itself. This indicated ribosomal bypass of the tryptophan codons in the absence of tryptophan. Detailed examination of W-Bumps position and its corresponding peptide sequences pinpointed towards ribosomal frameshifting events and their effects in the ribosome exit tunnel. In particular, W-Bumps strength was associated with the disorderedness level of potential out-of-frame peptides predicted downstream of tryptophan codons. Indeed, reporter assays demonstrated the induction of ribosomal frameshifting, and the generation of trans-frame proteins and their presentation at the cell surface after IFNγ treatment. Proteomics and immunopeptidomics analyses verified the production of IFNγ-induced trans-frame and out-of-frame aberrant peptides and their presentation on HLA class I molecules. Priming of naïve T cells from healthy donors with aberrant peptides resulted in identification of reactive, peptide-specific T cells. Altogether, our results suggest that IFNγ-induced IDO1-mediated tryptophan depletion plays a role in the immune recognition of melanoma cells by contributing to the diversity of the peptidome landscape, and by inducing the presentation of aberrant peptides.",

MS\/MS data were searched in Sequest HT against the the human Swissprot database (20,381 entries, release 2018_08). The maximum allowed precursor mass tolerance was 50 ppm and 0.06 Da for fragment ion masses. False discovery rates for peptide and protein identification were set to 1%.

Missing values were replaced by imputation based on the standard settings of Perseus, i.e. a normal distribution using a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 1.8. Differentially expressed proteins were determined using a t-test (threshold: FDR 1% or FDR 5% and S0: 0.13). GENCODE annotations (gencode v19) were used to calculate number of amino acids per protein as well as the least distance between a particular amino-acid (W,Y and N) Boxplots for every group were plotted in R. Statistical tests were down using Wilcoxon test in R. For the detection of frameshifted polypeptides, the CDS sequences of GRCh38 were downloaded from Ensembl 73. Prime transcripts (annotated as -001), which contain tryptophan codon and are highly expressed (log2(Normalized Read Counts) > 5) in the ribosome profiling data were included for further analysis. Transcripts with less than 50bp were discarded. Only CDS starting with ATG were kept. In cases of multiple in-frame TGG499 codons per transcript, each TGG along the sequence was frameshifted separately. Both +1 and -1 frameshifts at the TGG codon position were implemented. The CDS out-of-frame was in silico translated until the first stop codon. Finally, we generated a database of chimeric polypeptides, starting at the first tryptic cleavage start site, upstream of tryptophan (33628 instances), frame-shifted at TGG codon via both -1 and +1 frameshifts, until out-of-frame stop codons. No further filtering was implemented at the prescanning stage. MS data was analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16). The WT human proteome to run against was obtained from Uniprot database with SWISSPROT protein evidence level of 1. The in-frame protein expression data was further normalized and analyzed using DEP76, For the frame-shift proteome analysis, the MS data was analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16)74 with LFQ normalization, and then was scanned against the trans-frame polypeptide database together with the SWISSPROT proteins with Evidence level of 1. After scanning, a total of 124 peptides from the transframe polypeptide database were retained for further quantitative analysis, after subjecting to filtering for mapping to any proteomic and non-coding sequences. Only the peptides reproducibly detected across replicates were retained for further analysis, and the list included reverse peptide hits (n=41).",

    "description":"Extracellular vesicles have shown promise in the field of anti-tumor vaccines. EVs are antigen-presenting entities capable of eliciting potent T-cell responses and have therefore being explored as cell-free based peptide vaccine vectors. However, whether the EV ligandome sufficiently resembles the cell ligandome as to preserve antigenicity and immunogenicity of the ligands is still a crucial aspect to be addressed. In particular, when aiming to use EVs as cell-free vaccine vectors. To understand whether HLA-I complexes homing to EVs display the same ligand sequence features and characteristics than those homing to the cell surface, we used a highly sensitive MS-based immunopeptidomics approach to generate a comprehensive side-by-side analysis of the EV and whole-cell (WC) ligandomes. In this work we identified thousands of ligands derived from both EVs and WCs, which allowed a deep characterization of important ligand properties such as the occurrence of PTMs in both ligandomes. Our results indicate that EVs are as good as cells when it comes to antigen presentation, since the sequence properties of the antigens were conserved in EVs and WCs ligandomes. Interestingly, EVs were enriched in HLA-B ligands and cysteinylated peptides, which can ultimately affect the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the ligands and should be taken into consideration when developing cell-free EV-based peptide vaccination approaches.",

Conditioned media containing JY derived EVs was collected after 24h, spun down at 300 x g for 10 minutes, vacuum filtered on a 0.22μm and kept at 4ºC. Cells were re-plated at 1e6 cells\/mL and conditioned media was collected again after 24h and processed as previously described. Pre-cleared media was pooled and immediately processed by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 x g, 4ºC for 2h in a Sorvall T-865 rotor (ThermoFisher). The pellet was thoroughly resuspended in 10 mL PBS to wash away protein complexes and small EVs were finally pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 x g.

Unspecific searches were performed for precursors with mass between 797 and 1950 Da, corresponding to 8 – 12 amino acid peptides. Precursor ion and fragment ion tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da respectively, and for the main search, methionine oxidation and cysteine cysteinylation were set as variable modifications. For modification-specific analysis, searches for arginine (di-)methylation, phosphorylation (S\/T\/Y\/H) and asparagine deamidation were done separately always including methionine oxidation. Identified peptides were filtered to 5% false discovery rate (FDR) using percolator algorithm and PSMs with Xcorr ≥ 1 in at least one file and medium confidence were considered for peptide identification.   For proteomics analysis, raw data were searched in MaxQuant (v_1.6.10.4.3) (doi.org\/10.1038\/nprot.2016.136) against the same database using Andromeda search engine.

R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.   URL http:\/\/www.R-project.org\/) and aesthetics were further curated in Illustrator 2020 (Adobe). Binding affinity (BA) predictions were obtained from NetMHC 4.0 (10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv639) using JY cells haplotype (HLA-A*02:01, HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-C*07:02). Predicted BAs were further curated manually to achieve a stringing binder cut-off: peptide ligands with BA ≤ 50mM, BA ≤ 500 or BA > 500 were considered strong, weak or non-binders to the HLA proteins respectively. For cysteinylation binding affinity predictions, cysteine residues of cysteinylated≥5 peptides were substituted to “X”. Sequence logos were produced with Seq2Logo using the (P- weighted) Kullback-Leibler method (doi.org\/10.1093\/nar\/gks469) and only the NetMHC4.0 calculated 9-mer cores were used for these plots. For quantitative analysis of the ligandomes, data was processed using Prostar software (doi.org\/10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btw580) and normalization of EV and WC ligandomes was achieved by mean-centering approach. Subsequently, ranks were calculated from peptides shared between EV and WC ligandomes using normalized abundance values.

Proteins quantified (LFQ) in 2 out of 3 replicates in EV or WC lysates or in the >10 kDa captured fractions were log2 transformed and missing values were replaced individually for each sample from the normal distribution. Statistical differences were assessed by Student’s T-test and corrected p-values (q-value) were calculated using the permutation method with up to 250 iterations. Proteins were considered significant when q-value ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2. IP-captured proteins identified with ≥ 5 PSMs in EVs or WCs were used to build Protein Interaction Networks using STRING pathway analysis (10.1093\/nar\/gky1131). All plots were done using R packages and aesthetics were further curated in Illustrator 2020.",

    "title":"Identification of sensitiser modified HLA-peptides presented by keratinocytes",
    "description":"Skin sensitisation following the covalent modification of proteins by low molecular weight chemicals (haptenation) is mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of human leukocyte antigen molecules (HLA) presented on the surface of almost all nucleated cells. There are three nonmutually exclusive models for how haptens mediate CTL recognition: direct stimulation by haptenated peptides; hapten modification of HLA leading to an altered HLA-peptide repertoire; or a hapten altered proteome leading to an an altered HLA-peptide repertoire. To address the mechanism in skin, we set out to utilise proteomic analysis of keratinocyte presented antigens following exposure to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). We show that following DNCB exposure, cultured keratinocytes present cysteine haptenated (dinitrophenylated) peptides in multiple HLA molecules. In addition, we find that one of the DNCB modified peptides derives from the active site of cytosolic glutathione-S transferase-ω. These results provide support for the hypothesis that a key mechanism of skin sensitisation is stimulation of CTLs by haptenated peptides.",

Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) (99% purity; MW 202.55 Da) was obtained from Sigma, and DNCB-D3 (99% purity; MW 205.57Da) was obtained from QMX Laboratories.Stock solutions of each chemical were made by dissolving a 50:50 mix, by molar concentration, of deuterated and unlabelled chemical in ethanol to a final concentration 100 mM. DNCB stock solution was added to cells in serum free DMEM-F12 culture medium (Gibco) at a concentration of 10 μM DNCB, 0.1 % ethanol. Viability of cells after exposure to sensitiser was assayed using the Promega CellTiter 96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay, and cell toxicity to sensitiser was assayed using the Promega CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay.  Purification of HLA-I complexes and peptides  The snap frozen cell pellets (1-1.5 x 10^8 cells) were briefly thawed prior to the addition of 8 ml lysis buffer (0.02M Tris, 0.5% (w\/v) IGEPAL, 0.25% (w\/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.15mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.2mM iodoacetamide supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix) and briefly mechanically dispersed using a pipette. Samples were left to solubilise for 30 minutes at 4^∘C. Homogenates were clarified for 10 minutes at 2,000g, 4C and then for a further 60 minutes at 13,500g, 4^∘C. 2 mg of anti-MHC-I mouse monoclonal antibodies (W6\/32) covalently conjugated to Protein A sepharose (Repligen) were added to the clarified supernatants and incubated with constant agitation for 2h at 4^∘C. The captured HLA-I complex on the beads was washed sequentially with 10 column volumes of low (isotonic, 0.15M NaCl) and high (hypertonic, 0.4M NaCl) TBS washes prior to elution in 10% acetic acid and dried under vacuum. The dried eluate was re-suspended in 500 μL of 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)\/1% acetonitrile (ACN) prior to injection into the Thermo UltiMate 3000 HPLC system using a Chromolith HighResolution RP-18 endcapped 100-4.6 HPLC column (Merck) to separate and collect the peptides for mass spectrometry analysis. 0.5 mL buffer A (0.1% TFA).

    "description":"Objective: Antigen-specific immunotherapy is a promising strategy to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and (HBV-related) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To facilitate killing of malignant and\/or infected hepatocytes, it is vital to know which T cell targets are presented by HLA-I complexes on patient-derived hepatocytes. Here, we aimed to reveal the hepatocyte-specific HLA-I peptidome with emphasis on peptides derived from HBV proteins and tumor associated antigens (TAAs) to guide development of antigen-specific immunotherapy. Design: Primary human hepatocytes were isolated with high purity from (HBV infected) non-tumor and HCC tissues using a newly designed perfusion-free procedure. Subsequently, hepatocyte-derived HLA-bound peptides were identified by mass spectrometry after which source proteins were subjected to gene ontology and pathway analysis. Finally, all HBV-antigen and TAA-derived HLA-peptides were extracted and a selection was tested for immunogenicity. Results: We acquired a high quality HLA-I peptidome of 2x105 peptides, of which source proteins were associated with hepatocyte function. Importantly, we demonstrated HLA-I presentation of HBV-derived and TAA-derived peptides for the first time in immune cell-depleted primary liver cell isolates. The peptidome included 8 HBV-derived peptides and 14 peptides from 8 known HCC-associated TAAs that were exclusively identified in tumor eluates. Of these, immunogenicity was demonstrated for 5 HBV-derived and 3 TAA-derived peptides. Conclusion: We present a first HLA-I immunopeptidome of isolated primary human hepatocytes, devoid of immune cells. Our results directly aid development of antigen-specific immunotherapy for HBV infection and HCC. Described methodology can also be applied to personalize immunotherapeutic treatment of liver diseases in the future.",

    "title":"Low-Dose CDK4\/6 Inhibitors Induce Presentation of Pathway Specific MHC ligands as Potential Targets for Cancer Immunotherapy",
    "description":"Cyclin dependent kinase 4\/6 inhibitors (CDK4\/6i) lead to cell-cycle arrest but also trigger T cell-mediated immunity, which might be mediated by the qualitative and quantitative changes in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands on the cancer cell surface. We investigated the effects of CDK4\/6i, Abemaciclib and Palbociclib, on the immunopeptidome at subclinical, non-toxic, levels in breast cancer cell lines by biochemical isolation and identification of HLA ligands followed by network analyses. This treatment led to upregulation of cell surface HLA and revealed hundreds of induced HLA ligands in breast cancer cell lines. These new ligands were significantly enriched for peptides derived from proteins involved in the “G1\/S phase transition of cell cycle” including HLA ligands from CDK4\/6, Cyclin D1 and the 26S regulatory proteasomal subunit 4 (PSMC1). Interestingly, peptides from this essential biological process, that is targeted by Abemaciclib and Palbociclib, were predicted to be the most likely to induce a T cell response within the group of all induced HLA ligands when compared to HLA ligands from the DMSO-treated group. In strong contrast, peptides induced by solely one of the drugs had a lower T cell recognition score compared to the DMSO control suggesting that the observed effect is class dependent. This general hypothesis was exemplified by a peptide from PSMC1 which was among the HLA ligands with highest prediction scores and which elicited a T cell response in healthy donors.  Overall, these data demonstrate that CDK4\/6i treatment gives rise to drug-induced HLA ligands, that have the highest chance for being recognized by T cells if they are derived from the inhibited process of G1\/S phase transition, thus providing evidence that inhibition of a distinct cellular process leads to increased presentation of the involved proteins that may be targeted by immunotherapeutic agents.",

As viruses evolve by acquiring mutations, it is essential to identify a range of viral presented antigens. Utilizing HLA-peptidomics we Identified SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides presented by highly prevalent HLA Class-I (HLA-I) molecules using infected cells as well as overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 genes. We found 26 HLA-I peptides and 36 HLA class-II (HLA-II) peptides, which are estimated to be presented by at least one HLA allele in 99% of the world population. Among the identified peptides were recurrently presented HLA-I peptides, peptides derived from out-of-frame-ORFs and presentation-hotspots. Seven of these peptides were previously shown to be immunogenic, and we identified two novel immuno-reactive peptides using HLA-multimer staining. These results may aid the development of the next generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on viral-specific-presented antigens that span several of the viral genes.",

Samples were then incubated in rotation at 4˚C for 1 hour. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 48,000 g for 60 minutes at 4˚C and then passed through a pre-clearing column containing Protein-A Sepharose beads. HLA-I molecules were immunoaffinity purified from cleared lysate with the pan-HLA-I antibody (W6\/32 antibody purified from HB95 hybridoma cells) covalently bound to Protein-A Sepharose beads. HLA-II molecules were then purified by transferring the flow-through to similar affinity columns containing a pan-HLA-II antibody (purified from HB-145 hybridoma cells). Affinity columns were washed first with 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl and then with 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0. The HLA-peptide complexes were then eluted with 1% trifluoracetic acid followed by separation of the peptides from the proteins by binding the eluted fraction to Sep-Pak (Waters). Elution of the peptides was done with 28% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid for HLA-I and 32% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid for HLA-II.  Mass-spectrometry analysis of eluted HLA peptides ULC\/MS grade solvents were used for all chromatographic steps. Each sample was solubilized in 12 µL 97:3 water: acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Samples were loaded using split-less nano-Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (10 kpsi nanoAcquity; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase was: A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid and B) acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. Desalting of the samples was performed online using a reversed-phase Symmetry C18 trapping column (180 µm internal diameter, 20 mm length, 5 µm particle size, Waters). The peptides were then separated using a T3 HSS nano-column (75 µm internal diameter, 250 mm length, 1.8 µm particle size; Waters) at 0.35 µL\/minute. Peptides were eluted from the column into the mass spectrometer using the following gradient: 5% to 28%B in 120 minutes, 28% to 35%B in 15 minutes, 35% to 95% in 15 minutes, maintained at 95% for 10 minutes and then back to initial conditions. The nanoUPLC was coupled online through a nanoESI emitter (10 μm tip; New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) to a quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific) using a FlexIon nanospray apparatus (Proxeon).  For the discovery experiments, data was acquired in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, using a Top20 method. MS1 resolution was set to 70,000 (at 400m\/z), mass range of 300-1800m\/z, automatic gain control (AGC) of 3e6 and maximum injection time was set to 100 msec. MS2 resolution was set to 17,500, quadrupole isolation 1.8m\/z, AGC of 1e5, dynamic exclusion of 20 seconds and maximum injection time of 150 msec.

    "data_protocol":"Identification of SARS-CoV-2-derived HLA peptides SARS-CoV-2 proteome FASTA file of the infection experiment was generated according to the genome of the virus used for the infections (BetaCoV\/Germany\/BavPat1\/2020 EPI_ISL_406862, GISAID Acc. No. EPI_ISL_406862), as well as the 23 novel unannotated virus ORFs whose translation is supported by Ribo-seq (Finkel et al., 2020a). . For the overexpressed genes, the protein sequences used derived from the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2). Human proteome was downloaded from UniProt (https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/). MS data was analyzed using MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008) version 1.5.0.25. Enzyme specificity was set as “unspecific” and peptides’ FDR was set to 0.05. The “match between runs” option was disabled to avoid the matching of identifications across the samples.  For the identification of SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides, as Leucine and Isoleucine residues are generally considered indistinguishable by MS, because their molecular masses are the same, we removed from our list all peptides in which replacing their I\/L position (by either I\/L) resulted in peptides that can be derived from a human origin. We also removed peptides that have the same sequence (or with a change of I\/L) as possible non-coding regions (https:\/\/www.gencodegenes.org\/human\/release_19.html) as well as possible pseudogenes (http:\/\/www.pseudogene.org\/Human\/Human90.txt).

Peptides with %rank=< 2 or =<10 were kept for HLA-I and HLA-II, respectively. We predicted the binding of SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides also by MixMHCpred (peptide length: 8-14 for HLA-I and >=9 aa for HLA-II, peptides with %rank=<2 were determined as binders) (Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2017; Gfeller et al., 2018), HLAthena (HLA-I peptides, peptide length: 8-11, binders were determined according to columns 'best.MSi_allele' and 'assign.MSi_allele', %rank=<10) (Abelin et al., 2017; Sarkizova et al., 2020) and NeonMHC2 (HLA-II peptides, peptide length: >=9, %rank <=10). We validated the identification of randomly selected peptides by comparing their MS\/MS spectra fragmentation to that of synthetic peptides (see methods: “Validation using synthetic peptides”). We also clustered human and SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides using Gibbs clustering, to see if they clustered according to the expected HLA binding motifs of the patient (see methods: “Gibbs clustering”).",

Recent data showed that uORFs can encode for biologically active proteins and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-presented peptides and suggest their potential role in cancer cell development and survival. However, it is so far unclear if uORF-encoded peptides could serve as tumor-associated antigen targets and thus also play a role in cancer immune surveillance. Combining mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome analysis in primary tumor and healthy tissues and evaluation of proto-oncogene-associated uORF-mediated translational control we here identified a panel of HLA-presented tumor-associated uORF-derived antigens. These uORF-derived tumor antigens were further shown to induce multifunctional antigen-specific T cells, validating their suitability as antigen targets for T cell-based cancer immunotherapy. Our data further unravel the role of uORF-encoded peptides in malignant disease, suggesting uORF-derived tumor-associated antigens as targets for anti-cancer immune surveillance and immunotherapy development.",

Beside HLA molecules on cell surfaces, soluble HLA molecules (sHLA) are released in the blood suggested to impact cellular immune responses. We demonstrated that sHLA levels were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients and convalescent individuals compared to a control cohort and positively correlated with SARS CoV-2-directed cellular immunity. Of note, patients with severe courses of COVID-19 showed reduced sHLA levels. Mass spectrometry-based characterization of sHLA-bound antigenic peptides, the so called soluble immunopeptidome, revealed a COVID-19-associated increased diversity of HLA-presented peptides and identified a naturally presented SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide from the viral nucleoprotein in the plasma of COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, sHLA serum levels directly correlated with the diversity of the soluble immunopeptidome. Together, these findings suggest an inflammation-driven release of sHLA in COVID-19, directly influencing the diversity of the soluble immunopeptidome with implications for SARS-CoV-2-directed T cell-based immunity and disease outcome.",

    "description":"Mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics enables the comprehensive identification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) peptides from cell culture as well as from tissue or tumor samples and is increasingly applied for the identification of tumor-specific and viral T-cell epitopes. Although mass spectrometry is generally accounted as an unbiased method for MHC peptide identification, the physicochemical properties of MHC peptides can greatly influence their detectability. For instance, highly hydrophobic peptides get easily lost already during sample preparation when C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) is used for separating MHC peptides from proteins. To overcome this limitation, we established an optimized protocol for this sample preparation step applying restricted access material (RAM). Compared to C18-SPE, RAM-SPE improves the overall MHC peptide recovery and extends the landscape of mass spectrometry-detectable MHC peptides towards more hydrophobic peptides.",

    "description":"The presentation of virus-derived peptides by HLA class I molecules on the surface of an infected cell and the recognition of these HLA-peptide complexes by, and subsequent activation of, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells provides an important mechanism for immune protection against viruses. Recent advances in proteogenomics have allowed researchers to discover a growing number of unique HLA-restricted viral peptides, resulting in a rapidly expanding repertoire of targets for immunotherapeutics (i.e. bispecific antibodies, engineered T-cell receptors (TCRs), chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts)) to infected tissues. However, genomic variability between viral strains, such as Hepatitis-B virus (HBV), in combination with differences in patient HLA alleles, make it difficult to develop therapeutics against these targets. To address this challenge, we developed a novel proteogenomics approach for generating patient-specific databases that enable the identification of viral peptides based on the viral transcriptomes sequenced from individual patient liver samples. We also utilized DNA sequencing of patient samples to identify HLA genotypes and assist in target selection. Liver samples from 48 HBV infected patients, primarily from Asia, were examined to reconstruct patient-specific HBV genomes, identify regions within the human chromosomes targeted by HBV integrations and obtain a comprehensive view of HBV peptide epitopes using our HLA class-I (HLA-I) immunopeptidomics discovery platform. Two previously reported HLA associated HBV-derived peptides, HLA-A02 binder FLLTRILTI (S194-202) from the large surface antigen and HLA-A11 binder STLPETTVVRR (C141-151) from the capsid protein were validated by our discovery platform, but both were detected at a very low frequencies. In addition, we identified and validated, using heavy peptide analogues, novel strain-specific HBV-HLA associated peptides, such as GSLPQEHIVQK (P606-616) and variants. Overall, our novel approach can guide the development of bispecific antibody, TCR-T, or CAR-T based therapeutics for the treatment of HBV-related HCC and inform vaccine development.",

    "title":"Different Binding Motifs of the Celiac Disease Associated HLA Molecules DQ2.5, DQ2.2 and DQ7.5 Revealed by Relative Quantitative Proteomics of Endogenous Peptide Repertoires",
    "description":"In this study relative quantitative analysis of endogenous peptides by mass spectrometry combined with neural network analysis have been used to address why the alpha- or beta-chain sharing human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ molecules DQ2.5, DQ2.2 and DQ7.5 display different risks for celiac disease. Celiac disease is caused by intolerance to cereal gluten proteins, and HLA-DQ molecules are involved in the disease pathogenesis by presentation of gluten peptides to CD4+ T cells. It has recently been shown that T cells of DQ2.5 and DQ2.2 patients recognize different sets of gluten epitopes suggesting that these celiac disease associated DQ molecules select different peptides for display. To explore whether this is the case, we performed a comprehensive, large-scale comparison of the endogenous self-peptides bound to HLA-DQ molecules of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs). Peptides were eluted from affinity-purified HLA molecules of nine cell lines and subjected to quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry and MaxQuant software analysis. Altogether, 12712 endogenous peptides were identified at very different relative abundances. Hierarchical clustering of normalized quantitative data demonstrated significant differences in repertoires of peptides between the three DQ variant molecules. The neural network-based method, NNAlign, was used to identify peptide-binding motifs. The binding motifs of DQ2.5 and DQ7.5 concurred with previously established binding motifs. The binding motif of DQ2.2 was strikingly different from that of DQ2.5 with position P3 being a major anchor having a preference for threonine and serine. This is notable as three recently identified epitopes of gluten recognized by T cells of DQ2.2 celiac patients harbor serine at position P3. The study demonstrates that relative quantitative comparison of endogenous peptides sampled from our protein metabolism by HLA molecules provides clues to understand HLA association with disease.",

    "title":"Sampling from proteome to HLA-DR ligandome",
    "description":"Comprehensive analysis of the complex nature of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class II ligandome is of utmost importance to understand the basis for CD4+ T cell mediated immunity and tolerance. Here, we implemented important improvements in the analysis of the repertoire of HLA-DR-presented peptides, using hybrid mass spectrometry-based peptide fragmentation techniques on a ligandome sample isolated from matured human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC). The reported data set constitutes nearly 14 thousand unique high-confident peptides, i.e. the largest single inventory of human DC derived HLA-DR ligands to date. From a technical viewpoint the most prominent finding is that no single peptide fragmentation technique could elucidate the majority of HLA-DR ligands, due to the wide range of physical chemical properties displayed by the HLA-DR ligandome. Our in-depth profiling allowed us to reveal a strikingly modest correlation between the abundance levels of surface-presented peptides and the cellular expression of their source proteins. Important selective sieving from the sampled proteome to the ligandome, was evidenced by specificity in the sequences of the core regions both at their N- and C- termini, hence not only reflecting binding motifs but also dominant protease activity associated to the endolysosomal compartments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the HLA-DR ligandome reflects a surface representation of cell-compartments specific for biological events linked to the maturation of monocytes into antigen presenting cells. Our results present new perspectives into the complex nature of the HLA class II system and will aid future immunological studies in characterizing the full breadth of potential CD4+ T cell epitopes relevant in health and disease.",

    "sample_protocol":"The MUTZ-3 cell line, an HLA-DR10, -DR11, -DR52 (HLA-DRB1*10, HLA-DRB1*11, HLA-DRB3*01) positive acute myelo-monocytic leukemia, was grown under maintenance conditions in roller bottles in α-Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco), supplemented 20% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone), 100 U\/ml penicillin, 100 ug\/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Serva) and 25 U\/ml GM-CSF (Prepotech)[23, 24]. MUTZ-3 cells were induced into an immature DC state by a 5-day exposure to 1000 U\/ml GM-CSF (100 ng\/ml), 1000 U\/ml IL-4 (20 ng\/ml) and 2.5 ng\/ml TNF-α. Immature MUTZ-3 DC were matured by increasing the concentration of TNFa to 75 ng\/ml for 20 hr. During this maturation phase BCG antigens were present as an antigenic pulse with. The large bulk of 1.2x 109 cells stimulated MUTZ-3 was washed in ice cold PBS and snap frozen before lysing and solubilizing of cell membrane proteins with Nonidet P40 containing IP lysisbuffer (Thermo Scientific). After removal of the non-solubilized fraction using ultracentrifugation, HLA class II molecules were immunoprecipitated from the MUTZ-3 cell lysate using the HLA-DR-specific monoclonal antibody B8.11.2, as described previously[12]. An aliquot of the MUTZ-3 cell lysate after HLA-DR pull down was used for proteomics. HLA class II molecules and associated peptides were eluted with 10% acetic acid and peptides were collected by passage over a 10-kDa mw cutoff membrane and concentrated using vacuum centrifugation. The MUTZ-3 cell lysate was diluted in 2 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing one tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and one tablet of PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche). Cysteine residues were reduced and alkylated using 200 mM dithiotreitol (Sigma) and 200 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma). The proteins were digested with Lys-C (Roche Diagnostics) at an enzyme :protein ratio of 1:75 for 4 h at 37 °C. Two times diluted samples were digested with trypsin (Roche Diagnostics) overnight at 37°C at an enzyme : protein ratio of 1:100. Peptide mixtures were desalted using a 1-cc Sep Pack C18 columns (Waters) according manufacture’s protocol. HLA-DR eluted peptides were fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography[27]. The peptides were separated by a linear salt gradient ramping to 500 mM KCl in 0.1M HOAc and 35% acetonitrile at a column flow rate of 2 μl\/min. A total number of 26 fractions (2 min per fraction) were collected, dried down using a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted. Tryptic peptides from the MUTZ-3 digest were fractioned by SCX using a ZorbaxBioSCX-Series II column (0.8 mm I.D., 50 mm, 3.5 µm particle size, Agilent Technologies). A multistep gradient up to 500 mM Nacl in 0.05% formic acid 20% acetonitrile was used to separate the tryptic peptides[28]. For the HLA ligands, each individual SCX fraction was analyzed in triplicate by nanoscale LC-MS using a Thermo Scientific EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Odense, Denmark) and ETD enabled LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with either EThcD, HCD or ETD fragmentation[26]. The column effluent was directly electro-sprayed into the MS using a gold-coated fused silica tapered tip of ~5 m I.D. Full MS spectra (m\/z 300 to 1,500) were acquired in the Orbitrap at 60,000 resolution (FWHM). The 10 most abundant precursor ions were selected for either data-dependent EThcD, HCD or ETD fragmentation (isolation width of 1.5 Th) at an abundance threshold of 500 counts. Fragment ions were detected in the Orbitrap analyzer at 15,000 resolution (FWHM). The automatic gain control (AGC) target in MS\/MS was set to 3 × 105 for EThcD, 7 × 104 for HCD, and 1 × 105  ETD. The maximum ion accumulation time for MS scans was set to 250 ms and for MS\/MS scans to 1500 ms. For EThcD, modified instrument firmware was used to allow all-ion HCD fragmentation after an initial ETD. The HCD normalized collision energy was set to 32%. The ETD reaction time was set to 50 ms and supplemental activation and charge dependent activation time was enabled. Precursor ions with unknown and +1 charge states were excluded from MS\/MS analysis. Dynamic exclusion was enabled (exclusion size list 500) with a repeat count of 1 and an exclusion duration of 60 s. The SCX fractions of the tryptic digested MUTZ-3 cells were analyzed by LC-MS\/MS using an Agilent 1290 Infinity System (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, DE) modified for nanoflow LC (passive split) connected to a TripleTOF analyzer (AB Sciex).  A voltage of 2.7 kV was applied to the needle. The survey scan was from 375 to 1250 m\/z and the high resolution mode was utilized, reaching a resolution of up to 40,000. Tandem mass spectra were acquired in high sensitivity mode with a resolution of 20,000. The 20 most intense precursors were selected for subsequent fragmentation using an information dependent acquisition, with a minimum acquisition time of 50 ms.",
    "data_protocol":"Data analysis  The raw files collected from the TripleTOF were first recalibrated based on five background ions with m\/z values of 391.2847, 445.12003, 51913882, 593.15761, 667.17640. The calibrated raw files were converted to mgf by the AB Sciex MS Data Converter (version 1.3 beta) program before analysis with Proteome Discoverer 1.4. RAW files acquired with the Orbitrap Elite were directly analyzed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software package (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) using default settings unless otherwise stated. For the EThcD and ETD spectra the non-fragment filter was added with the following settings: the precursor peak was removed within a 1 Da window, charged reduced precursors and neutral loss peaks were removed within a 0.5 Da window. MS\/MS scans were searched against the human Uniprot database using the SEQUEST HT mode (Proteome Discoverer 1.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Precursor ion and MS\/MS tolerances were set to 3 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. In SEQUEST, spectrum matching was set to one for c and z ions for ETD data, b and y ions for HCD and b, y, c and z for EThcD. The data were searched with no enzyme specificity and asparagine deamidation and methionine oxidation set as variable modification. Percolator was used to filter the peptide-to-spectrum matches (PSM) to a < 1% false discovery rate (FDR)[29] and the peptide identification list was further filtered for Xcorr score ≥ 1.5.  TripleTOF data files were analyzed using identical settings unless otherwise stated. Precursor ion tolerance was set to 20 ppm and the MS\/MS tolerance to 0.15 Da. In SEQUEST, spectrum matching was set to 1 for y and b ions. The data were searched with specificity for trypsin and enabling 2 miss cleavages. Oxidation (M), N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation (S, T and Y), methylation (R, K), dimethylation (R, K) were set as dynamic modification and carbamidomethylation (C) was set as a static modification.  The amount of HLA-DR peptides presented at the cell surface expressed as copy number per cell were estimated based on the MS intensities provided by proteome discoverer and known amounts of the synthetic peptides angiotensin-III and oxytocin which were spiked in each fraction prior to LC-MS analysis. CELLO2GO[30] was used for protein subcellular localization prediction.  The peptide binding affinities and the 9 a.a. binding core for HLA-DR10, HLA-DR11 and HLA-DR52 were predicted using the NetMHpan-3.0 algorithm[31]. Peptides with a moderate to high binding affinity (IC) < 1000 nM were considered as potential binder for a particular allele. The GibbsCluster-1.0 algorithm[32] was for simultaneous alignment and clustering of complete date set of HLA-DR-associated peptides. Gibbs clustering was performed using default settings[32], with  preference of hydrophobic amino acids at position P1, the number of clusters set to 1-4,  λ set to 0.8. Sequence logo’s we created using IceLogo[33], with p-values set to 0.005. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relation between the abundance data for proteins obtained in the global proteome analysis and in the HLA-DR ligandome analysis of stimulated MUTZ-3 cells, based on log10 transformation of spectral counts-protein length ratio; correlation was expressed as r2.",

    "title":"Identification of In Vivo HLA-DR-Presented Self-Peptides (T Cell Epitopes) in Synovial Tissue, Synovial Fluid and Peripheral Blood in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis or Lyme Arthritis",
    "description":"HLA-DR molecules are highly expressed in synovial tissue (ST), the target of the immune response in chronic inflammatory arthritides, including in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Lyme arthritis (LA). In the current study, we identified HLA-DR-presented self-peptides (T cell epitopes) in ST, synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SF), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB) from five patients with RA and eight with LA. Altogether, from 22 samples, 1,532 non-redundant HLA-DR-presented peptides were identified that were derived from 778 source proteins. Moreover, as the study progressed, application of newer, high sensitivity LC-MS instruments resulted in the identification of larger numbers of HLA-DR-presented peptides. Surprisingly, the source proteins for HLA-DR-presented peptides were as likely to have intracellular as extracellular locations. Although the number of peptides identified was greater in ST than in SF or PB, 68% of the peptides identified in SF were found in ST, and 55% of the peptides in PB were found in ST. Two RA patients had the same HLA-DR genotype (DRB1*0401 and 0101), and 44% of the peptides identified in these two patients were the same. In contrast, among the patients with RA or LA who had no shared HLA-DR alleles, only 6% of the peptides were the same. In the RA patients, HLA-DR-presented peptides were identified from source proteins that are thought to serve as potential autoantigens: collagen, enolase, fibrinogen, fibronectin, immunoglobulin and vimentin. Interestingly, peptides from these same source proteins were also commonly found in LA patients. However, citrullinated T cell epitopes were not identified in any patient. Thus, LC-MS\/MS techniques are now sensitive enough to identify large numbers of T cell epitopes from tissue or fluids in individual patients. Importantly, analysis of SF or PB allowed us to identify a broader range of HLA-DR-presented self-peptides from individual patients and from patients seen earlier in the disease.",

    "sample_protocol":"ST, SF, and PBMC Preparation — ST samples (8-10 g) were prepared using the protocol described previously (19). Heparinized SF and PBMC (~3 to 8 x 107 cells) were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque (MP Biomedicals) separation and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to analysis. On the day of purification, SF and PB samples were quickly thawed by placing in a 37 °C water bath for two minutes. Cells were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Life Technologies) by centrifuging at 800 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended with 10 mL lysis buffer: 150 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane -HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium solution, 0.04% sodium azide, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 µg\/mL leupeptin, 10 µg\/mL pepstatin A, 5 µg\/mL aprotinin, and 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. Immunoaffinity purifications of HLA-DR complexes from SF and PBMC were performed using the protocol previously described for synovial tissue samples.  LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer: A nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) through a TriVersa NanoMate ion source (Advion, Ithaca, NY). Peptide enrichment was performed with a trapping column (180 µm × 20 mm, 5 µm 100 Å Symmetry C18, Waters Corp) at a flow rate of 15 µL\/min for 1 min, and separation was achieved with a capillary column (150 µm × 10 cm, 1.7 µm 130 Å BEH C18, Waters Corp). Buffer A contained 1% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% formic acid in water, and buffer B contained 1% water and 0.1% formic acid in ACN. A linear gradient of buffer B from 2% to 40% over 52 min was used at a flow rate of 0.5 µL\/min. The capillary voltage was set to 1.7 kV using the NanoMate, and the capillary temperature was set to 120 °C. The mass spectra were recorded over the range of m\/z 300-2000 at a resolution of 60,000 (the width of the peak at half its maximum height at m\/z 300) at a scan rate of approximately 1.2 s\/spectrum. Tandem MS was performed for the five most abundant, multiply-charged species in the mass spectra that had a signal intensity threshold of 8000 NL. The normalized collision energy for collision-induced dissociation (CID) was set to 35%, and helium was used as the collision gas. MS\/MS spectra were recorded with LTQ XL linear ion trap.  Q Exactive plus mass spectrometer: A nanoAcquity UPLC system was coupled to a Q Exactive plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) through a TriVersa NanoMate ion source. The same peptide enrichment and separation columns, HPLC solvents and gradients, and NanoMate capillary voltage and temperature used on the LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer were also applied on the Q Exactive plus mass spectrometer. Survey MS scans were performed over the range m\/z 400-2000 with a resolution of 70,000. The 15 most abundant, multiply-charged ions were selected for higher-energy collisional induced dissociation (HCD) MS\/MS with a resolution of 17,500, an isolation width of 1.5 m\/z, and a normalized collision energy of 27%. All spectra were recorded in profile mode.  6550 iFunnel QTOF LC\/MS: Two 1260 HPLC systems were coupled to a 6550 iFunnel QTOF mass spectrometer through a chip cube interface (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A Polaris-HR-3C18 chip was used for peptide enrichment and separation. The flow rate on the enrichment column was set at 2 µL\/min with sample flush volume set as 4 µL. With the same solvents used on the Waters UPLC systems, a gradient of buffer B from 2% to 5% over 0.1 min, 5% to 20% over 74.9 min, 20% to 40% over 10 min, 40% to 90% over 10 min, stayed at 90% buffer B for 5 min, returned to 2% buffer B and stayed for 10min was used at a flow rate of 0.3 µL\/min for peptide separation. The capillary voltage was set to 1.7 to 1.95 kV, and the gas temperature was set to 225 °C. The survey mass spectra were recorded over the range of m\/z 295-1700 with acquisition rate of 8 spectra\/second. Tandem MS was recorded over the range of m\/z 50-1700 with acquisition rate of 3 spectra\/second. Precursor ion isolation was performed with narrow isolation window of 1.3 m\/z. Tandem MS was performed for the 20 most abundant, multiply-charged species in the mass spectra that had a signal intensity threshold of 5000 counts or a relative threshold of 0.001%. The collision energy for CID was set as using the formula [3.1×(m\/z)\/100+1] for doubly charged precursor ions and [3.6×(m\/z)\/100-4.8] for triply and higher charged precursor ions. Active exclusion was enabled after one tandem spectrum and released after 0.15 min. All spectra were recorded in centroid mode.",
    "data_protocol":"Protein Database Searching — In our original study, the International Protein Index (IPI) database was used to identify HLA-DR-presented peptides from ST samples from two patients each with RA or LA (identified here as patients RA1, RA2, LA1 and LA2) (19). Because the IPI database is now closed and no longer maintained, the spectra of these four patients were reanalyzed using the UniProt protein database and the findings were compared to our original study. Using the UniProt database, ~96-98% of the peptides identified were the same as those identified using the IPI database. Therefore, in the current study, HLA-DR-presented self peptides were identified by searching the Mascot generic file from each sample against UniProt human database concatenated with a decoy database. The decoy databases were generated by randomizing each protein sequence in the database using the Perl script decoy.pl (Matrix Science). Mascot 2.4.0 (Matrix Science), OMSSA Browser 2.1.1 (NCBI), and X!Tandem tandem-win-12-10-01-1 (The Global Proteome Machine Organization www.thegpm.org) were used for database searches. Cysteinylation of cysteine, deamidation of glutamine and asparagine, pyroglutamic acid from amino-terminal glutamine and glutamic acid, and oxidized methionine were specified as the variable modifications in all searches. In addition, evaluation for the post-translational modification of arginine to citrulline was also included as a variable modification. For this purpose, peaks exhibiting the difference in molecular weight between arginine and citrulline (0.98402 Da) were searched for each arginine residue in the database.  For data acquired using LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer, precursor ion error tolerance was set as 0.01 Da and fragment ion error tolerance was set as 0.5 Da; for data acquired using Q Exactive plus mass spectrometer, precursor ion error tolerance was set as 10 ppm and fragment ion error tolerance was set as 20 mmu; for data acquired using 6550 iFunnel QTOF mass spectrometer, precursor ion error tolerance was set as 20 ppm and fragment ion error tolerance was set as 50 mmu. “No enzyme” was specified for all the protein database searches. Mascot score cutoff was set at ≥20; OMSSA e-value cutoff was set to ≤0.01; and X!Tandem e-value cutoff was set at ≤10. In addition, consensus identifications of peptides by at least two search programs were acquired using a Microsoft Access query. Removal of redundant peptide sequences - Unique consensus peptides were submitted to a software generated in-house that collates and sets aside redundant peptides that have amino acid sequences overlapping in a core sequence. Peptide sequences with at least six continuous overlapping amino acid residues were considered redundant, and the peptide with the longest amino acid sequence was output from the software program. The same software was also used to compare the consensus peptides among different samples. Peptide sequences with at least six continuous overlapping amino acid residues were considered consensus. Identification of source proteins – All of the unique consensus peptides identified by at least two protein database search engines were submitted to another software program generated in-house that screens the peptide sequences with the UniProt human protein database. This database excludes decoy sequences. All the accession numbers of the source proteins containing the screened peptide sequence were shown. Although a number of peptides could have been derived from more than one source protein, the proteins were usually closely related. Therefore, a given peptide was counted as having only one source protein. The consensus source proteins among different samples were acquired by matching the first 252 characters (the maximum allowed) of each source protein accession numbers using a Microsoft Access query. Go annotation for protein location — To determine protein location, the first protein accession number from each source protein was submitted to the Software Tool for Rapid Annotation of Proteins (STRAP) 1.5 (Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) (24, 25). The output was condensed manually to one of four groups: extracellular, plasma membrane, intracellular, or multiple locations. Statistics – All p values are two-tailed. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

    "description":"Treatment of cancer cells with anti-cancer drugs often fails to achieve complete remission. Yet, such drug treatments may induce alteration in the tumor’s gene expression patterns, including those of Cancer\/Testis Antigens (CTA). The degradation products of such antigens can be presented as HLA peptides on the surface of the tumor cells and be developed into anti-cancer immunotherapeutics. For example, the DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Decitabine) has limited anti-tumor efficacy, yet it induces the expression of many genes, including CTAs that are normally silenced in the healthy adult tissues. In this study, the presentation of many new HLA peptides derived from CTAs and induced by Decitabine was demonstrated in three human Glioblastoma cell lines. Such presentation of CTA-derived HLA peptides can be exploited for development of new treatment modalities, combining drug treatment with anti-CTA targeted immunotherapy. The Decitabine-induced HLA peptidomes include many CTAs that are not normally detected in healthy tissues or in cancer cells, unless treated with the drug. In addition, the study included large-scale analyses of the simultaneous effects of Decitabine on the transcriptomes, proteomes and HLA peptidomes of the human Glioblastoma cells. It demonstrates the poor correlations between these three levels of gene expression, both in their total levels and in their response to the drug.",

After incubation with Decitabine for 72 hours, the cells were harvested, counted and prepared for FACS, HLA peptidomics, proteomics analysis or for RNA sequencing.  Affinity purification of HLA molecules: HLA class I molecules were purified from three biological replicates for each Glioblastoma cell line. Each replica with about 5*108 cells was lysed with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitors Cocktail (Sigma), 1 mM PMSF and 1% octyl-β-D glucopyranoside (Sigma) in PBS at 4°C for 1 hour. The cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 45 minutes at 18,000 rpm, 4°C. The recovered HLA class I molecules were immunoaffinity purified using the W6\/32 mAb bound to Amino-Link beads (Thermo Scientific) . The HLA molecules with their bound peptides were eluted from the affinity column with five column volumes of 0.1 N acetic acid. The eluted HLA class I proteins and the released peptides were loaded on disposable C18 columns (Harvard Apparatus) and the peptides fraction was recovered with 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The peptide fractions were dried using vacuum centrifugation, reconstituted in 100 μl of 0.1% TFA, reloaded on Stage-Tips , eluted with 80% ACN, dried and reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid for μLC-MS-MS analysis.   Identification of the HLA peptides: The HLA peptides were resolved by capillary chromatography with 75µ ID laser-pulled capillaries, self-packed with 3.5µ Reprosil-Aqua C18 (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was performed with Q-Exactive plus mass spectrometers (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Two approaches for proteome analysis were employed in this study, the first was in-solution tryptic digest followed by resolution of the peptides by long (3 hours) one dimensional reversed phase capillary chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry and the other was based on in-gel proteolysis of 5 gel slices from each lane, followed by two hours μLC-MS-MS of the tryptic peptides from each gel slice, as in (70). 30 µg of total proteins were used for the in-gel digest and μLC-MS-MS and 2.5 µg of proteins were used for the in-solution digest and μLC-MS-MS analysis.",

    "description":"Using proteogenomics, we identified and analyzed 25,172 major histocompatibility complex class I-associated peptides (MAPs) isolated from B lymphocytes of 18 individuals who collectively expressed 27 HLA-A,B allotypes. While 58% of genes were the source of 1-64 MAPs per gene, 42% of genes were not represented in the immunopeptidome. Overall, we estimate the immunopeptidome presented by 27 HLA-A,B allotypes covered only 17% of exomic sequences expressed in subjects’ cells. We identified several features of transcripts and proteins that enhance MAP production. From these data we built a logistic regression model that predicts with high accuracy whether a gene from our dataset or from independent datasets would generate MAPs. Our results show preferential selection of MAPs from a limited repertoire of gene products with distinct features. The notion that the immune system can monitor MAPs covering only a fraction of the protein coding genome has profound implications in autoimmunity and cancer immunology.",

    "description":"Cancer somatic mutations can generate neoantigens that distinguish malignant from normal cells.  Such neoantigens have been implicated in response to immunotherapies including immune checkpoint blockade, yet their identification and validation remains challenging.  Here we discover neoantigens in human mantle cell lymphomas using an integrated strategy for genomic and proteomic tumor antigen discovery that interrogates peptides presented within the tumor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules.  We applied this approach to systematically identify neoantigen peptides in diagnostic tumor specimens from 17 patients. Remarkably, the 52 discovered neoantigenic peptides were invariably derived from the lymphoma immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy or light chain variable regions. Although we could identify MHC presentation of private germline polymorphic alleles, no mutated peptides were recovered from non-Ig somatically mutated genes.  The immunoglobulin variable region somatic mutations were almost exclusively presented by MHC-II.  We found T-cells specific for an immunoglobulin-derived neoantigen in the blood of a patient using MHC-II tetramers, and these T-cell clones expanded in frequency following tumor vaccination.  These results demonstrate that an integrative approach combining MHC isolation, peptide identification and exome sequencing is an effective platform to uncover tumor neoantigens.  Application of this strategy to human lymphoma implicates immunoglobulin neoantigens as targets for lymphoma immunotherapy.",

    "description":"Indian rhesus macaques are arguably the most reliable animal models in AIDS research. In this species the MHC class I allele Mamu-B*08, among others, is associated with elite control of SIV replication. A similar scenario is observed in humans where the expression of HLA-B*27 or HLA-B*57 has been linked to slow or no progression to AIDS after HIV infection. Despite having large differences in their primary structure, it has been reported that HLA-B*27 and Mamu-B*08 display peptides with sequence similarity. To fine-map the Mamu-B*08 binding motif and assess its similarities with that of HLA-B*27 we affinity purified the peptidomes bound to these MHC class I molecules and analyzed them by LC-MS\/MS identifying several thousands of endogenous ligands. Sequence analysis of both sets of peptides revealed a degree of similarity in their binding motifs, especially at peptide position 2 (P2) where arginine was present in the vast majority of ligands of both allotypes. In addition, several differences emerged from this analysis: (i) ligands displayed by Mamu-B*08 tended to be shorter and to have lower molecular weight, (ii) Mamu-B*08 showed a higher preference for glutamine at P2 as a suboptimal binding motif and (iii) the second major anchor position, found at P-omega, was much more restrictive in Mamu-B*08. In this regard, HLA-B*27 bound efficiently peptides with aliphatic, aromatic (including tyrosine) and basic C-terminal residues while Mamu-B*08 preferred peptides with leucine and phenylalanine in this position. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular basis of the presentation of peptides by Mamu-B*08 and can contribute to the detection of novel SIV epitopes restricted by this allotype.",

The reported anchor motif of the corresponding HLA-DR molecules was determined years ago based on a small number of peptide ligands and binding assays. DR2a could display a set of peptides complementary to that presented by DR2b or, alternatively, a similar peptide repertoire but recognized in a different manner by T cells. It is known that DR2a and DR2b share some peptide ligands, although the degree of similarity of their associated peptidomes remains unclear. In addition, the contribution of each molecule to the global peptide repertoire presented by the HLA-DR15 haplotype has not been evaluated. We used mass spectrometry to analyze the peptide pools bound to DR2a and DR2b, identifying 169 and 555 unique peptide ligands of DR2a and DR2b, respectively. The analysis of these sets of peptides allowed the refinement of the corresponding binding motifs revealing novel anchor residues that had been overlooked in previous analyses. Moreover, the number of shared ligands between both molecules was low, indicating that DR2a and DR2b present complementary peptide repertoires to T cells. Finally, our analysis suggests that, quantitatively, both molecules contribute to the peptide repertoire presented by cells expressing the HLA-DR15 haplotype.",

    "title":"Comparison of the MHC I immunopeptidome repertoire of B-cell lymphoblasts using two isolation methods",
    "description":"Significant technological advances in both affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry have facilitated the identification of peptides associated with the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, and enabled a greater understanding of the dynamic nature of the immunopeptidome of normal and neoplastic cells. While the isolation of MHC I-associated peptides (MIPs) typically used mild acid elution (MAE) or immunoprecipitation (IP), limited information currently exists regarding their respective analytical merits. Here, we present a comparison of these approaches for the isolation of two different B-cell lymphoblasts cell models, and report on the recovery, reproducibility, scalability and complementarity of identification from each method. Both approaches yielded reproducible datasets for peptide extracts obtained from 2 to 100 million cells, with 2016 to 5093 MIPs, respectively. The IP typically provides up to 6.4 fold increase in MIPs compared to the MAE. We extended the comprehensiveness of these immunopeptidome analyses using personalized genomic database of B-cell lymphoblasts, and discovered that 0.4 % of their respective MIP repertoire harbored non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (also known as minor histocompatibility antigens, MiHAs).",

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells were grown in RPMI1640 containing Hepes and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin\/streptomycin and L-glutamine. The cells were washed with PBS and either used fresh or stored at -800C.  B-ALL specimen used in this study was from an adult male B-ALL patient. B-ALL cells were expanded in vivo after transplantation in mice as follows. NOD Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl\/SzJ (NSG) mice were bred in a specific pathogen–free animal facility. B-ALL cells were thawed at 37°C, washed and resuspended in RPMI. A total of 1-2 × 106 B-ALL cells were transplanted via the tail vein into 8–12-week-old sub-lethally irradiated NSG mice. Mice were sacrificed 30-60 days post-injection when showing signs of disease. Spleens were mechanically dissociated and leukemic cells were isolated by Ficoll gradient. Purity and viability of the samples (usually > 90%) were then assessed by flow cytometry. B-ALL cells were identified as human CD45+CD19+.  Flow cytometry  Data acquisition was performed on a BD Canto II cytometer (BD Bioscience). The analysis was done with BD FACSDiva 4.1 software. Antibodies used were anti-human CD45 Pacific Blue, anti-human CD19 PE-Cy7, anti-mouse CD45.1 APC-efluor 730 and anti-human HLA-ABC PE. The absolute membrane density of MHC I was evaluated by indirect  labeling with a purified anti-human HLA-ABC (clone W6\/32), using commercially available QIFIKIT® (Dako) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Peptide isolation by immunoprecipitation  The W6\/32 antibodies were incubated in PBS for 60 minutes at room temperature with PureProteome protein A magnetic beads at a ratio of 1 mg of antibody per mL of slurry. Antibodies were covalently cross-linked to magnetic beads using dimethylpimelidate. Biological replicates of cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL PBS pH 7.2 and solubilized by adding 1 mL of detergent buffer containing PBS pH 7.2, 1% (w\/v) CHAPS supplemented with Protease inhibitor cocktail. After 60 minute incubation with tumbling at 4°C, samples were spun at 10000g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Post-nuclear supernatants were transferred into new tubes containing magnetic beads coupled to W6\/32 antibodies at a ratio of 10 mg of W6\/32 antibody per 1 × 106 cells. Samples were incubated with tumbling for 180 minutes at 4°C and placed on a magnet to recover bound MHC I complexes to magnetic beads. Magnetic beads were first washed with 4 × 1 mL PBS, then with 1 × 1 mL of 0.1X PBS and finally with 1 × 1 mL of water. MHC I complexes were eluted from the magnetic beads by acidic treatment using 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). To remove any residual magnetic beads, eluates were transferred into 2.0 mL Costar mL Spin-X centrifuge tube filters (0.45 mm) and spun 2 minutes at 3000g. Filtrates containing peptides were separated from MHC I subunits (HLA molecules and b-2 macroglobulin) using home-made stage tips packed with twenty 1 mm diameter octadecyl (C-18) solid phase extraction disks. Stage tips were pre-washed first with methanol then with 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.2% TFA and finally with 0.1% formic acid (FA). Samples were loaded onto  the stage tips and the peptides were retained on the stage tips while the HLA molecules and b-2 macroglobulin were found in the flow through. Stage tips were washed with 0.1% FA and peptides were eluted with 30% ACN in 0.1%TFA. The peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation and then stored at -20°C until MS analysis.  Peptide isolation by mild acid elution  Peptides were released by mild acid elution using citrate pH 3.3 buffer. Samples were desalted using an HLB cartridge and filtered with a 3,000 Da cut-off column.  Mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing  Vacuum dried fractions were resuspended in 17 µL of 5% ACN, 0.2% FA and analyzed by LC–MS\/MS using an Easy nLC1000 coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated on a custom C18 reversed phase column (150 mm i.d. X 100 mm) using a flow rate of 600 nL\/min and a linear gradient of 5–30% ACN (0.2% FA) in 56 min, followed by 3.3 min at 80% ACN (0.2% FA). Survey scan (MS1) were acquired with the Orbitrap at a resolving power of 60,000 (at m\/z 200) over a scan range of 350-1200 m\/z with a target values of 3 x 106 with a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Mass calibration used an internal lock mass (protonated (Si(CH3)2O))6; m\/z 445.120029) and mass accuracy of peptide measurements was within 5 ppm. MS\/MS spectra were acquired at higher energy collisional dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 25. Up to twenty precursor ions were accumulated with a precursor isolation window of 1.6 m\/z, an advanced gain control (AGC) of 5 × 104 with a maximum injection time of 50 ms and fragment ions were transferred to the Orbitrap analyzer operating at a resolution of 30, 000 at m\/z 200.",
    "data_protocol":"Peptide identification and label-free quantification  Database searches were performed using PEAKS 8.

Subject-specific protein sequence databases that incorporate single amino-acid polymorphism (SAP) detected by RNAseq were generated with a Python script relying on pyGeno (v1.2.9. Ensembl reference genome release 75 (GRCh37.p13) and 88 (GRCh38.p10) were used for B-LCL and B-ALL cells, respectively. Polymorphisms were called by Casava for B-LCL and FreeBayes for B-ALL. Additionally, for B-ALL, only sequences with expressed transcript were retained.

    "description":"The Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase I (ERAP1) trims peptides to their optimal size for binding to Major Histocompatibility Complex class I proteins. The natural polymorphism of this enzyme is associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in epistasis with the major risk factor for this disease, HLA-B*27, suggesting a direct relationship between AS and HLA-B*27-bound peptides. Three polymorphisms that affect peptide trimming protect from AS: K528R, D575N\/R725Q, and Q730E. We characterized and ranked the effects of each mutation, and their various combinations, by quantitative comparisons of the HLA-B*27 peptidomes from cells expressing distinct ERAP1 variants. Five features were examined: peptide length, N-terminal flanking residues, N-terminal residues of the natural ligands, internal sequences and affinity for B*27:05. Polymorphism at residue 528 showed the largest influence, affecting all five features regardless of peptide length. D575N\/R725Q showed a much smaller effect. Yet, when co-occurring with K528R, it added to this latter change in decreasing ERAP1 activity. Polymorphism at residue 730 showed a significant influence on peptide length, reflecting differential trimming of nonamers and longer peptides. Accordingly, multiple features were affected by the Q730E mutation in a length-dependent way. The alterations induced in the B*27:05 peptidome by natural ERAP1 variants with different K528R\/Q730E combinations reflected separate and additive effects of both mutations. Thus, the influence of ERAP1 on HLA-B*27 is very diverse at the population level, due to the multiplicity and complexity of ERAP1 variants, and to the distinct effects of their co-occurring polymorphisms, leading to significant modulation of disease risk among HLA-B*27-positive individuals.",

    "description":"The array of peptides presented to CD8+ T cells by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules is referred to as the MHC class I immunopeptidome. Although the MHC class I immunopeptidome is ubiquitous in mammals and represents a critical component of the adaptive immune system, very little is known about its baseline composition across all tissues and organs in vivo. In this study, we applied mass spectrometry (MS) technologies to draft a tissue-based atlas of the MHC class I immunopeptidome in the C56BL\/6 mouse model. Overall, 19 normal mouse tissues were extracted and a total number of ~30,000 high-confidence H2Db\/Kb-associated peptides were identified and annotated in the atlas. The raw MS output files, the catalogue of H2Db\/Kb-associated peptides, the tissue origin(s) of individual peptides and the H2Db\/Kb-specific peptide spectral libraries, which consist of consensus spectra calculated from repeat measurements of the same peptide sequence, were shared via the SysteMHC Atlas project (dataset identifier SYSMHC00018). We expect that this unique dataset will be further expended in the future and will be re-used by the community to 1) investigate the tissue-specificity of the immunopeptidome, 2) perform highly reproducible spectral library-based analysis of immunopeptidomes from mice cohorts, and 3) rapidly identify disease-specific H2Db\/Kb peptide antigens from various mouse models of autoimmune diseases and cancers.",

Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MHC class I peptides from tissues and cell lines were analyzed in DDA mode using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos system. Peptides were separated on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 column (250 mm x 75 um i.d., 2 Å particle size; ThermoFisher Scientific) using a flow rate of 300 nl min-1 and a linear gradient of 4–29.6% aqueous ACN (with 0.1% formic acid) in 120 min. Full mass spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap analyser operated at a resolving power of 120,000 (at m\/z 200). MS\/MS spectra were acquired in HCD mode with a normalized collision energy of 27%. Precursors were selected in the \"top speed\" mode with a cycle time of 3 s. Fragment ions (charge state 2-6+) were accumulated up to an AGC target value of 50,000 with a maximum injection time of 54 ms and the option \"Inject ions for all available parallelizable time\" enabled, and were detected in the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolution of 30,000 (at m\/z 200). Dynamic exclusion was enabled for 30 s after a selection event with a tolerance of ± 10 ppm.  AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+ MHC class I peptides were also analyzed using a TripleTOF system in DDA mode as described previously. Samples were analyzed on an Eksigent nanoLC system coupled with an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+ System. The samples were separated in a 75 µm-diameter PicoTip emitter (New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed with 20 cm of Magic 3 µm, 200 Å C18 AQ material (Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany). The loaded material was eluted from the column at a flow rate of 300 nl\/min and a linear gradient of 2–35% aqueous ACN (0.1% formic acid) over 120 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in DDA top20 mode, with 500 and 150 ms acquisition time for the MS1 and MS2 scans respectively, and 20 s dynamic exclusion. MS\/MS spectra were acquired in CID mode. Rolling collision energy with a collision energy spread of 15 eV was used for fragmentation.",
    "data_protocol":"Database search engines, statistical validation and spectral library generation Raw mass spectrometry files were converted into the mzXML format by msConvert.

Oxidation (M) was the only variable modification. We used default search settings for both engines with the following key parameters: Precursor tolerance was set to ±15 p.p.m., high accuracy fragment ion tolerance was set to ±0.05 Da, and digestion specificity was set to unconstrained. The search identifications were then combined and statistically scored using PeptideProphet and iProphet within the TPP (4.8.0). iProphet estimated cut-off of 1% FDR was used. Spectral libraries were generated by SpectraST with default consensus library building parameters. H2Db- and H2Kb-specific peptide spectral libraries were generated on the atlas level that contains consensus spectra of peptides from different samples. For a given allele-specific spectral library, the same peptide ions generated under various fragmentation methods were specified and kept separated as different library entries.",

    "description":"Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and somatic hypermutation have the potential to create neoantigens in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma.  However, the presentation of these putative immunoglobulin neoantigens by B cell lymphomas has not been proven. We used MHC immunoprecipitation followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) to define antigens presented by follicular lymphomas (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphomas (MCL).  We found presentation of the clonal immunoglobulin molecule, including neoantigens by both class I and class II MHC, though more commonly in class II MHC.  To determine whether B cell activation could promote presentation of immunoglobulin neoantigens, we used a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists to upregulate expression of MHC-II.   This resulted in enhanced class II MHC presentation of the immunoglobulin variable region including neoantigens.  These findings demonstrate that immunoglobulin neoantigens are presented across most subtypes of B cell lymphomas.  Activation of lymphoma cells to upregulate antigen presentation boosts presentation of immunoglobulin neoantigens and represents a strategy for augmenting lymphoma immunotherapies.",

We hypothesized that neoantigens derived from recurrent shared mutations would be attractive targets for future immunotherapy and sought to study the Class I and II HLA ligandomes of thirteen primary AML tumor samples and two AML cell lines (OCI-AML3 and MV4-11) using mass spectrometry. We identified two endogenous, mutation-bearing HLA Class I ligands from NPM1, which are predicted to bind the common HLA haplotypes, HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*02:01 respectively. We further derived CD8+ T cells from healthy donor peripheral blood samples which bound mutant-peptide loaded A*03:01 and A*02:01 tetramers, suggesting a new source of NPM1 mutation-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) for future evaluation. Since NPM1 is mutated in approximately one-third of patients with AML, the finding of endogenous NPM1 neoantigens supports future studies evaluating immunotherapeutic approaches against this target, for this subset of patients with AML.",

For all searches with SEQUEST the msConvert program (v3.0.45) was used to generate peak lists from the original data, and spectra were then assigned to peptides using the SEQUEST (v28.12) algorithm. For all searches with PEAKS the RAW data files were imported into PEAKS and subjected to default data refinement (deisotoping, charge deconvolution, peak centroiding). For all searches, the parent mass error tolerance was set to 20 ppm and the fragment mass error tolerance to 0.02 Da. For SEQUEST and PEAKS DB, enzyme specificity was set to none and oxidation of methionines and deamidation (N,Q), cysteinylation, and phosphorylation (S, T, Y) was searched as a variable modification. High-confidence peptide identifications were selected at a 1% false discovery rate with the Percolator algorithm (Käll et al., 2007).",

The lysis buffer was added to the cells at a concentration of 1 x 108 cells\/mL. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation with a table-top centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge, Hamburg, Germany) at 4°C at 14,200 rpm for 50 min. Meningioma tissues were placed in tubes containing the same lysis buffer and homogenized on ice in 3-5 short intervals of 5 seconds each using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany) at maximum speed. For one gram of tissue, 10 to 12 mL of lysis buffer was required. Cell lysis was performed at 4°C for 1 hour. Tissue lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm in a high speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, JSS15314, Nyon, Switzerland) at 4°C for 50 minutes. The cells and tissue lysates were loaded on stacked 96-well single-use micro-plates (3µm glass fiber, 10µm polypropylene membranes; ref number 360063, Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, Massachusetts). Purification of pan-HLA-II peptides were performed following depletion of HLA-I as previously described (2). For the sequential purification of HLA-DR and HLA-II from tissues, three plates were used. The first plate contained protein-A sepharose 4B (Pro-A) beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) for depletion of antibodies (pre-clear plate), the second plate contained same beads cross-linked to the anti HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies and the third plate contained the beads cross-linked to anti HLA-II monoclonal antibodies. For the sequential purification of HLA-DR and HLA-II from cells, only the last two plates were used. The Waters Positive Pressure-96 Processor (Waters, Milford, Massachusetts) was employed. The second and third plates were washed separately with 4 times 2 mL of 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) (Carlo-Erba, Val de Reuil, France) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 4 times 2 mL of 400 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and again with 4 times 2 mL of 150 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Finally, the plates were washed twice with 2 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Each affinity plate was stacked on top of a Sep-Pak tC18 100 mg Sorbent 96-well plate (ref number: 186002321, Waters) already equilibrated with 1 mL of 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1 % TFA and with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA. The HLA and peptides were eluted with 500 µL 1% TFA into the Sep-Pak plate and then we washed this plate with 2 mL of 0.1 % TFA. Thereafter, HLA-II and HLA-DR peptides were eluted with 500 µL of 32% ACN in 0.1% TFA into a collection plate. Recovered HLA-II and HLA-DR peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator plus Eppendorf) and stored at -20°C.  LC-MS\/MS analyses of HLA-II peptides: Prior to MS analysis HLA-II and HLA-DR peptide samples were re-suspended in 10 µL of 2% ACN in 0.1 % FA and aliquots of 3 uL for each MS run were placed in the Ultra HPLC autosampler. HLA peptides were separated by a nanoflow HPLC (Proxeon Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Odense) coupled on-line to a Q Exactive HF or HFX mass spectrometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen) with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems).

    "description":"Background: Patient derived organoids (PDOs) can be established from colorectal cancers as in vitro models to interrogate cancer biology and its clinical relevance. We applied mass spectrometry (MS) immunopeptidomics to investigate neoantigen presentation and whether this can be augmented through interferon gamma (IFN) or MEK-inhibitors. Methods: Four PDOs from chemotherapy refractory and one from a treatment naïve CRC were expanded to replicates with 100 million cells each, and HLA class I and class II peptide ligands were analysed by MS. Results: We identified an average of 9,936 unique peptides per PDO which compares favourably against published immunopeptidomics studies, suggesting high sensitivity. Loss of heterozygosity of the HLA locus was associated with low peptide diversity in one PDO. Peptides from genes without detectable expression by RNA-sequencing were rarely identified by MS. Only 3 out of 612 non-silent mutations encoded for neoantigens that were detected by MS. Treatment of four PDOs with IFN upregulated HLA class I expression and qualitatively changed the immunopeptidome, with increased presentation of IFN-inducible genes. HLA class II presented peptides increased on average 16-fold with IFN treatment. MEK-inhibitor treatment showed no consistent effect on class I or II HLA expression or the peptidome. Importantly, no additional HLA class I or II presented neoantigens became detectable with any treatment.  Conclusions: Only 3 out of 612 non-synonymous mutations encoded for neoantigens that were detectable by MS. Although MS has sensitivity limits and biases, and likely underestimated the true neoantigen burden, this established a lower bound of the percentage of non-silent mutations that encode for presented neoantigens, which may be as low as 0.5%. This could be a reason for the poor responses of non-hypermutated CRCs to immune checkpoint inhibitors. MEK-inhibitors recently failed to improve checkpoint-inhibitor efficacy in CRC and the observed lack of HLA upregulation or improved peptide presentation may explain this.",

    "description":"The features of peptide antigens that contribute to their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Although the stability of peptide-MHC (pMHC) is known to be important, current assays assess this interaction only for peptides in isolation and not in the context of natural antigen processing and presentation2–4. Here, we present a novel method which provides a comprehensive and unbiased measure of pMHC stability for thousands of individual ligands detected simultaneously by mass spectrometry (MS). The method allows rapid assessment of intra- and inter-allelic differences in pMHC stability and reveals broader profiles of stability than previously appreciated. The additional dimensionality of the data facilitated the training of a model which improved the prediction of peptide immunogenicity, specifically of cancer neoepitopes. This assay can be applied to any cells bearing MHC or MHC-like molecules, offering insight into not only the endogenous immunopeptidome, but also that of neoepitopes and pathogen-derived sequences.",

    "description":"The importance of CD4+ T helper (Th) cells is well appreciated in view of their essential role in the elicitation of antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses. However, the mechanisms that determine the selection of immunodominant epitopes within complex protein antigens remain elusive. Here, we used ex vivo stimulation of memory T cells and screening of naïve and memory T cell libraries, combined with T cell cloning and TCR sequencing, to dissect the human naïve and memory CD4+ T cell repertoire against the influenza pandemic H1 hemagglutinin (H1-HA). We found that naïve CD4+ T cells have a broad repertoire, being able to recognize naturally processed as well as cryptic peptides spanning the whole H1-HA sequence. In contrast, memory Th cells were primarily directed against just a few immunodominant peptides that were readily detected by mass spectrometry-based MHC-II peptidomics and predicted by structural accessibility analysis. Collectively, these findings reveal the presence of a broad repertoire of naïve T cells specific for cryptic H1-HA peptides, and demonstrate that antigen processing represents a major constraint determining immunodominance.",

HA-specific EBV-B cell clones isolated from IgG+ memory B cells of each of the four donors were pulsed overnight with 200 ng\/ml recombinant H1-HA at a cellular density of 5×106 cells\/ml. MHC-II complexes were purified from about 3×107 HA-pulsed moDCs or 109 HA-pulsed EBV-B cells with a protocol adapted from Bassani-Sternberg M. et al (Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015). Briefly, the B cells were lysed with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% octyl-β-D glucopyranoside (Sigma), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) in PBS at 4°C for 1 h.

    "description":"Accumulating evidence indicates that alternative translation events occur in all cell types, suggesting that the proteome is more complex than previously anticipated. We elected to broaden the repertoire of human cryptic proteins by designing an approach combining ribosome profiling, which gives a precise view of truly active translation events, and mass spectrometry, which is so far the best way to screen with confidence the cellular proteome. This allowed building complete but noiseless customized protein databases suitable for MS-based protein identification. The analysis of the immunopeptidome and whole proteome of DLBCL cell lines led to the identification of 710 novel protein isoforms along with 1856 new cryptic proteins, from which 72% derived from allegedly non-coding regions of the genome. Globally, cryptic proteins were very distinct from canonical proteins, as they were shorter, less stable, initiated at a diversified set of start codons and were at least 5-fold more efficient for MHC-I peptide generation. The translation efficiency of novel isoforms and cryptic proteins was at least as good as for canonical proteins and we propose that some of them could regulate the translation of canonical proteins involved in cellular stress and cancer cell growth.",

    "description":"Peptide vaccination remains a viable approach to induce T-cell mediated killing of tumours. To identify potential T-cell targets for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) vaccination, we examined the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) on the transcriptome, proteome and immunopeptidome of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Using high resolution mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 84,131 peptides from 9,647 source proteins presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and HLA-II alleles. Treatment with IFNγ resulted in a remarkable remoulding of the immunopeptidome, with only a 34% overlap between untreated and treated cells across the HLA-I immunopeptidome, and expression of HLA-II only on treated cells. IFNγ increased the overall number, diversity and abundance of the immunopeptidome, as well as the proportion of coverage of source antigens. The suite of peptides displayed under conditions of IFNγ treatment included many known tumour associated antigens, with the HLA-II repertoire sampling 265 breast cancer associated antigens absent from those sampled by HLA-I. Quantitative analysis of the transcriptome (10,248 transcripts) and proteome (6783 proteins) of these cells revealed 229 proteins and transcripts were commonly differentially expressed, most of which involved in downstream targets of IFNγ signalling including components of the antigen processing machinery such as tapasin and HLA. However, these changes in protein expression did not explain the dramatic modulation of the immunopeptidome following IFNγ treatment.  These results demonstrate the high degree of plasticity in the immunopeptidome TNBC cells following cytokine stimulation and provide evidence that under pro-inflammatory conditions a greater variety of HLA-I and HLA-II vaccine targets are unveiled to the immune system. This has important implications for the development of personalised cancer vaccination strategies.",

    "description":"In recent years the clinical success of T cell-based immunotherapy approaches has revolutionized treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. However, still some patients do not respond to available therapies at all, others for limited time only. A promising low side-effect approach is peptide-based immunotherapy, which relies on specific immune recognition of tumor-associated human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-presented peptides. In this study, we developed a workflow for the immunopeptidome-guided design of off-the shelf warehouses for personalized peptide vaccines using the example of chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL). The so defined warehouses could provide the basis for different T cell-based immunotherapy approaches such as TCR-engineered T cell transfer or multi-peptide vaccinations. The warehouse approach enables a fast and cost-effective way to provide a personalized T cell-based immunotherapeutic approach. The here defined peptide warehouse is already utilized for a personalized multi-peptide vaccine trial (iVAC-XS15-CLL01, NCT04688385).",

    "description":"Standardisation of Immunopeptidomics experiments across laboratories is a pressing issue within the field, and currently a variety of different methods for sample preparation and data analysis tools are applied. Here, we compared different software packages commonly used to interrogate immunopeptidomics datasets, in order to understand to which extent differences in performance can be observed. We found that a de novo-assisted database search reports substantially more peptide sequences (~30-70%) compared to three database search engines at a global FDR of <1%. This effect was reproducible across four immunopeptidomic datasets. We validated the results using data generated with a synthetic library of 2000 HLA-associated peptides from four HLA alleles, half of which were previously observed by LC-MS, and half were predicted only. Our investigation reveals that search engines create a bias in peptide sequence length distribution and peptide amino acid composition. Therefore, the choice of peptide identification method highly influences the proportion of peptide sequences identified for each HLA allele, and resulting data should be interpreted with caution.",

    "description":"CD4+ T cells orchestrate the adaptive immune response against pathogens and cancer by recognizing epitopes presented on MHC-II molecules. The high polymorphism of MHC-II genes represents an important hurdle towards accurate predictions of CD4+ T-cell epitopes in different individuals and different species. Here we generated and curated a dataset of 627,013 unique MHC-II ligands identified by mass spectrometry. This enabled us to determine the binding motifs of 88 MHC-II alleles across human, mouse, cattle and chicken. Analysis of these binding specificities combined with X-ray crystallography refined our understanding of the molecular determinants of MHC-II motifs and revealed a widespread reverse binding mode in MHC-II ligands. We then developed a machine learning framework to accurately predict binding specificities and ligands of any MHC-II allele. This tool improves and expands predictions of CD4+ T-cell epitopes, as demonstrated by the identification of several viral and bacterial epitopes following the aforementioned reverse binding mode.",

    "sample_protocol":"Purification of HLA-II, HLA-DR, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ bound peptides   Anti-pan-HLA-II and anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies were purified from the supernatant of HB145 (ATCC, HB-145) and HB298 cells (ATCC, HB-298), respectively, grown in CELLLine CL-1000 flasks (Sigma-Aldrich) using protein A-sepharose 4B beads (pro-A beads; Invitrogen) while anti-HLA-DP (Leinco Technologies) and anti-HLA-DQ (from either Biorad or MyBioSource) were purchased from the respective providers. Antibodies were cross-linked separately to pro-A beads at a concentration of 1 to 2 mg of antibodies per milliliter of beads following incubation with pro-A beads for 1h at room temperature. Chemical crosslinking was performed by addition of dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.2M sodium borate buffer, pH 9 (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 20mM for 30min. The reaction was quenched by incubation with 0.2M ethanolamine, pH 8 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2h.  Cells were lysed in PBS containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), 1mM EDTA, 1:200 protease inhibitors cocktail (SigmaAldrich), 1mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Roche) and 1% octyl-beta-dglucopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 1h. The lysis buffer was added to cells at a concentration of 1×108 cells per milliliter. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation with a table-top centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge) at 4 °C at 14,200 rpm for 50min. Meningioma tissues were placed in tubes containing the same lysis buffer and homogenized on ice in three to five short intervals of 5 s each using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (IKA) at maximum speed. For 1 g of tissue, 10–12ml of lysis buffer was required. Cell lysis was performed at 4 °C for 1h. Tissue lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm in a high-speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, JSS15314) at 4 °C for 50min.  Tissue cleared lysates were loaded first on affinity purification columns (BioRad, 731-1550) containing pro-A beads (pre-clear column, to remove non-specific antibodies). Tissues and cells lysates were loaded sequentially on columns containing cross-linked beads in the following order: CM647 samples on anti-DQ, DP, DR, pan-HLA-II antibodies, 3865 and JY on anti-DR, DQ, DP, pan-HLA-II antibodies, and samples RA957, 3947-GA, 4021 on anti-DR,DP,DQ, pan-HLA-II antibodies. The affinity columns were then washed with 2 column volumes of 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl; Carlo-Erba) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 2 column volumes of 400 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and again 2 column volumes of 150 mM sodium chloride in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Finally, the beads were washed in 1 column volume of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. HLA complexes and the bound peptides were eluted by adding twice 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or 4 times Acetic acid 0.1N at a volume equivalent to or slightly higher than the volume of beads present in the column. HLA peptides were purified and concentrated with by loading into Sep-Pak tC18 96-well plates (Waters) preconditioned with 1 mL of 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA and then with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA. The C18 wells were then washed with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA. The HLA peptides were eluted with 500 μL of 32% ACN in 0.1% TFA into Eppendorf tubes. Recovered peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −20°C.  LC–MS\/MS analyses of HLA-II peptides  HLA-II, HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ peptide samples were resuspended in 10 μl of 2% ACN in 0.1% formic acid (FA) and aliquots of 3 μl were used for each MS analysis. The LC-MS\/MS system consisted of an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 450-mm analytical column (8-μm tip, 75-μm inner diameter, PicoTip emitter, New Objective) packed with ReproSil-Pur C18 (1.9-μm particles, 120 Å pore size, Dr Maisch GmbH). The separation was performed at a flow rate of 250 nl\/min by a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile (solvent B) and 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A).HLA-II peptides were eluted by the following gradient: 0 to 80 min (2 - 32% B); 80 to 84 min (32 – 45% B); 84 to 85 min (45 – 100% B); and 85 to 95 min (100% B). Data were acquired using a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method. Full-scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 (at 200 m\/z) with an auto gain control (AGC) target value of 3×106 ions. For Tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS), ten most abundant precursor ions were sequentially isolated, activated by higher-energy collisional dissociation (NCE = 27) and accumulated to an AGC target value of 2×105 with a maximum injection time of 120 ms. In the case of assigned precursor ion charge states of one, and from six and above, no fragmentation was performed. MS\/MS resolution was set to 15,000 (at 200 m\/z).

    "description":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most relevant por-cine pathogens worldwide. Active control of the disease relies on modified live virus vaccines (MLVs), as most inactivated vaccines provide very limited protection. Neutralizing antibodies occur late in infection, therefore CD8+ T cells are considered important correlates of protection and are a frequent focus of investigation. Our aim was to identify viral peptides naturally bound by the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), and to confirm their ability to stimu-late CD8+ T cells. For this purpose, we immunoprecipitated MHC-I\/peptide complexes of PRRSV (strain AUT15-33) -infected cells (SLA-I Lr-Hp 35.0\/24mod) to isolate the viral epitopes and ana-lyzed them with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Furthermore, we employed these identified peptides to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of previously PRRSV infected pigs and measured the PRRSV-specific CD8+ T cell re-sponse with an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Our data reveals that PRRSV non-structural proteins (NSPs) encoded in open reading frame 1a and 1b (ORF1) present the major source of MHC-I presented peptides. Additionally, we show that our identified epitopes are able to trig-ger IFNγ responses in vitro. These findings are a basis for understanding the proteasomal degra-dation of PRRSV proteins, the cellular ability to display them via MHC-I, and their potential to restimulate CD8+ T cells.",

Cells were washed three times at 300 x g for 3 minutes at RT with a Sigma 3-10 centrifuge (Sigma, Germany). The supernatant was dis-carded and the cell pellet frozen at -80°C. For cell lysis, RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 1% NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail for tissue (Carl Roth, Germany), pH 7.5) was added to the frozen pellet and incubated over night at 4°C. The cell lysate was centrifuged with a fixed angle Mikro 20 centrifuge (Hettich, Germany) at 21.382 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant stored at 4°C until further use. Protein A\/G magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) were washed three times with RIPA buffer in a magnetic rack. For the precipitation of MHC-I\/peptide complexes, the an-tibody PT85A was used, as previously described [28]. PT85A and isotype control (Mouse IgG2a Isotype Control, Invitrogen, MA, USA) were diluted in RIPA buffer and incubated with the magnetic beads on a shaker for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and incubated with the centrifuged cell lysate on a shaker for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and three times with IP wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris). At last, the MHC-I\/peptide complex was eluted from the magnetic beads with 8M Urea (BioUltra, ≥99%, Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) at RT. Until LC-MS analy-sis, the samples were stored at -20°C. Recovered peptides were reduced with a final concentration of 10 mM dithiothreitol and incubated at 56°C for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature, reduced cysteines were alkylated with iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 55 mM for 30 min in the dark. Urea content was diluted down to a concentration of 2M. Peptides were then concentrated and desalted via solid phase extraction (SPE) using stage tips with two stacked C18 plugs (Empore™, MERCK KgaA, Germany) [29]. Samples were acidified by addition of a final concentration of 1% TFA. Stage tips were activated three times with acetonitrile and equil-ibrated three times with 0.4% formic acid, 2% TFA in water before loading the samples. Salts were removed with 100 µL of 0.1% TFA and purified peptides were eluted using two times 50 µL 90% acetonitrile, 0.4% formic acid. Finally, eluted peptides were dried in a vacuum concentrator and reconstituted in 10 µL of 0.1% TFA. Label-free 1D-shotgun LC-MS\/MS analysis was performed as untargeted Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Dionex Ultimate 3000RSLC nano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via nanoflex source interface. Samples were loaded onto a trap column (Pepmap 100, 5 μm, 5 × 0.3 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 10 μL\/min using 0.1% TFA.

    "title":"Restoring Tumor Immunogenicity with Dendritic Cell Reprogramming",
    "description":"Immune evasion is an important hallmark of cancer ensured by diverse strategies, including immunosuppression and downregulation of antigen presentation. Here, to restore immunogenicity of cancer cells, we employed the minimal gene regulatory network of highly immunogenic type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) to reprogram cancer cells into professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). We showed that enforced expression of PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 (PIB) was sufficient to induce cDC1 phenotype in 33 cell lines derived from human and mouse hematological and solid tumors. PIB gradually modified the cancer cell transcriptional and epigenetic program imposing global antigen presentation and cDC1 gene signatures within 9 days. cDC1 reprogramming restored the expression of antigen presentation complexes as well as co-stimulatory molecules at the cell surface, leading to the presentation of endogenous antigens on MHC-I, and to CD8+ T cell mediated killing. Functionally, tumor- APCs acquired the ability to uptake and process exogenous proteins and dead cells, secreted inflammatory cytokines and cross-presented antigens to naïve CD8+ T cells. Importantly, tumor-APCs were efficiently generated at the single cell level from primary cancer cells of 7 solid tumors that presented antigens to memory and naïve T-cells, as well as to activated patient-specific intra-tumoral lymphocytes. Alongside antigen presentation, tumor-APCs harboring TP53, KRAS and PTEN mutations showed impaired tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Finally, using in vivo mouse models of melanoma, we showed that intra-tumoral injection of tumor-APCs promoted lymphoid infiltration, delayed tumor growth and increased survival. The anti-tumor immunity elicited by tumor-APCs was synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors enabling tumor eradication. Our approach combines cDC1’s antigen processing and presenting abilities with endogenous generation of tumor antigens and serves as a platform for the development of novel immunotherapies based on endowed antigen presentation in cancer cells.",

    "sample_protocol":"Purification MHC-I-eluted peptides Anti–MHC-I monoclonal antibody (28-8-6S) was purified from the supernatant of HB-51 hybridoma cells (ATCC) using Protein A–Sepharose 4B beads (Invitrogen). Antibodies were cross-linked to Protein A–Sepharose 4B beads at a concentration of 5 mg of antibodies per 1 mL volume of beads.  To improve sensitivity, two groups of samples were processed: 3 biological replicated of 6*108 B16-F10 cells intended for data dependent acquisition (DDA) measurement to generate a spectral library generation, and 3 biological replicates of samples of 106 B16-F10 cells either sorted GFP transduced, reprogramed, or IFNg treated, and control cells, for data independent acquisition (DIA) measurement. B16-F10 cell were lysed in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.50% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM EDTA, 1:200 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Roche), and 1% octyl-β-D glucopyranoside (Sigma-Alrich) at 4°C for 1 hour. Samples of 2*108 cells were lysed in 4 mL, samples of 106 cells in 1 mL lysis buffer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation with a table-top centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge) at 4°C at 20,000 g for 50 minutes. MHC-I molecules were purified by incubating the cleared lysates with HIB antibodies cross-linked to Protein A–Sepharose 4B beads in affinity columns for 3 hours at 4°C. 300uL of beads were used for samples of 2*108 and 200uL for samples of 106 cells. The affinity columns were then washed as follows: 2 column volumes of 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 2 column volumes of 400 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and again 2 column volumes of 150 mM sodium chloride in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. Finally, the beads were washed in 1 column volume of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. MHC complexes and the bound peptides were eluted at room temperature by adding twice 500uL of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Sep-Pak tC18 96-well plates (Waters), preconditioned with 1 mL of 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA and then with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA, were used for the purification and concentration of MHC-I peptides. Elutions containing MHC-I molecules and peptides were loaded in the Sep-Pak tC18 96-well plates and the C18 wells were then washed with 2 mL of 0.1% TFA. The MHC-I peptides were eluted twice with 250uL of 28% ACN in 0.1% TFA. MHC-I peptides containing elutions were transferred into Eppendorf tubes. Recovered peptides were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −20°C. MS acquisition Prior to MS analysis, MHC-I peptide samples were resuspended in 8μL of 2% ACN and 0.1% formic acid (FA). Then, to technical replicates of 3 μL per biological samples were loaded on the column for each measurement by LC-MS\/MS. The LC-MS system consists of an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled on-line to Q Exactive HF and or HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 450-mm homemade column of 75-μm inner diameter packed with ReproSil Pur C18–AQ 1.9-μm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH). For DDA the analytical separation was performed for a period of 130 minutes using a gradient of H2O\/FA 99.9%\/0.1% (solvent A) and CH3CN\/FA 80%\/0.1% (solvent B). The gradient was run in sequential, linear steps: 0 to 110 min (2%-25% B), 110 to 114 min (25%-35% B), 114 to 115 min (35%-100% B), and 115 to 130 min (constant at 100% B) at a flow rate of 250 nL\/minute. The mass spectrometer was operated as follows: full-scan MS spectra were acquired from m\/z = 300–1,650 at a resolution of 60,000 (m\/z = 200) with a maximum injection time of 80 ms. The auto gain control (AGC) target value was set to 3 × 106 ions. MS\/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30’000 (m\/z = 200) using a top 20 method with an isolation window of 1.2 m\/z, and a collision energy of 27 (HCD). For all MS\/MS scans ions were accumulated to an AGC target value of 2*105 with a maximum injection time of 120 ms. Precursors with a charge of 4 or more were excluded from fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion was set to 20s. For DIA the analytical separation was performed for a period of 65 minutes using a gradient of H2O\/FA 99.9%\/0.1% (solvent A) and CH3CN\/FA 80%\/0.1% (solvent B). The gradient was run in sequential, linear steps: 0 to 52 min (2%-25% B), 52 to 54 min (25%-35% B), 54 to 55 min (35%-100% B), and 55 to 65 min (constant at 100% B) at a flow rate of 250 nL\/minute. The DIA method consisted of one full-scan MS spectra, acquired from m\/z = 300–1,650 (Resolution = 60’000, ion accumulation time = 60 ms), and 22 MS\/MS scans (suppl. table). For each MS\/MS scan the automatic gain control (AGC) target value was set to 3 × 106 ion, resolution was set at 30’000 and a stepped normalized collision energy (25.5, 27, 30) approached was used. Maximum ion accumulation was set to auto, fixed first mass to 200 m\/z. The overlap between consecutive MS\/MS scans was 1 m\/z.",
    "data_protocol":"All DDA files were used to generate a library with a database search using fragpipe v17.1, including MSFragger v3.5. The FASTA file contained all reviewed mouse uniprot entries (May 2022), as well as the manually added uniprot sequences P11269, P03386, Q3UFS3, and Q2TA50. The search space comprised unspecifically digested peptides with a length of 8 to 14 amino acids. Variable modifications included methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation and no fixed modifications were applied. Maximal precursor and fragment ion deviation was set to 20 ppm. Peptide, ion, and peptide spectrum match FDRs were set to 0.01, no protein FDR was applied. DIA files were searched with the library described above using SpectroNaut 16 with a precursor q-value cut-off of 0.01. Data analysis Technical replicates were averaged for each biological replicate. MHC-I peptide predicted as binders were ranked by intensity (highest intensity = rank 1). The ranks were then normalized by dividing each rank by the total amount of binders per sample and subsequently transformed (f(x) = x - 1), yielding the Intensity score that ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates the lowest intensity in a sample and 1 indicates the highest intensity in a sample. Peptide binding affinities were predicted with NetMHCpan [1] and MixMHC [2]. Peptides were considered as binders when they received a rank percentage of 2% or less by either of the two tools for at least one allele. Data analyses were done with Julia and R, visualizations with R only.",
